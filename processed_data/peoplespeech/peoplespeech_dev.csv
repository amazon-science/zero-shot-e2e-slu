34156,Jericho_Planapalooza_10-17-13/Jericho_Planapalooza_10-17-13_DOT_mp3_00023.flac,14.94,-1,that's not in the town some people may say well why in the world are you doing that we have no control over that you're absolutely right but it makes sense you have to look at things in context and so you'll see that we we do that we also see that there are some established neighborhoods and
34157,Jericho_Planapalooza_10-17-13/Jericho_Planapalooza_10-17-13_DOT_mp3_00111.flac,14.95,-1,working in but what does that zone mean in this community so it's like this sort of micro calibration so it's a lot of kind of upfront thinking and figuring out for us but in the end it's a very simple document that we go through so here's what these things look like and who
34158,Jericho_Planapalooza_10-17-13/Jericho_Planapalooza_10-17-13_DOT_mp3_00122.flac,14.89,-1,like where you just scattered buildings kind of around the parking lots all around them and that's not what we're talking about when we're talking about character based it's about buildings that fit in with other buildings and so here that might not be appropriate here but it fits in with a detached single family houses

34160,Jericho_Planapalooza_10-17-13/Jericho_Planapalooza_10-17-13_DOT_mp3_00147.flac,14.7,-1,apparently people beat us to the punch and they're just doing it because here they did it because it made since it was like well where else we're going to put it we're out of room you know and and probably people in the community said heck no or not putting it on the front and so anyway so
