42844,om-557-134906/439zo2OajWE_DOT_mp3_00112.flac,14.73,-1, and and the department of finance or finance committee the solutions that i've been outlined i think are viable i think the golf course is worth it and you know refinancing it for all the you know the
42845,om-557-134906/439zo2OajWE_DOT_mp3_00133.flac,5.92,-1, the team that is there and the good job that they're doing thank you thank 
42846,om-557-134906/439zo2OajWE_DOT_mp3_00191.flac,14.83,-1,more expensive to contract out maintenance but that's not my recollection from the from the report in december could you clarify that yes the it's hard to know which
42847,om-557-134913/am6RToYadBY_DOT_mp3_00015.flac,14.83,-1,by hud so the idea there is to bump the rents a little bit hoping to encourage them to move on so we can take some off the waiting list this restatement request benefits both the owner
42848,om-557-134913/am6RToYadBY_DOT_mp3_00069.flac,14.92,-1,revenues we did receive more mutual aid revenues last year but as of one thousand two hundred and thirty one we'd only received about a hundred thousand by that point next i'll be providing a little bit more detail on our miss leis revenues i'll go back
42849,om-557-134350/FeUCcbwLRPA_DOT_mp3_00061.flac,14.68,-1,that they would qualify into those pots of money because there's no nonprofit organization or nor is that in the first year lease there's no way event it's just marketing and then i'm gonna have mister matt for speak to the cool block program he's been working with us more close than anybody here and i think he has some
42850,om-557-134350/FeUCcbwLRPA_DOT_mp3_00069.flac,14.92,-1,of the city oes department its bilingual we have the cert program as well as lease dos which you've seen of late certainly through the thomas fire and the chiefs concern was either
42851,om-557-134893/D5lge1pgUOk_DOT_mp3_00117.flac,14.92,-1,period so that you're never taking a hit in one year a very large loss or a very large gain in any one year but it doesn't really give you the true market value rate so if you move on to the next slide what we did was which is not required in the capper but what
42852,om-557-134893/D5lge1pgUOk_DOT_mp3_00183.flac,14.65,-1,specializes in the audits of cities we do over i think we do about sixty two cities right now in state of california a very small number of our clients are able to actually have the expertise to prepare their own cafer your staff here
42853,om-557-134893/D5lge1pgUOk_DOT_mp3_00212.flac,14.95,-1,feel that the controls here said at the city are sound and strong also that the audit communication letter lists various things such as if we had some significant
42854,om-557-134927/2uGdmbASCeQ_DOT_mp3_00028.flac,14.73,-1,classes the tech spaces in is always in use by staff for in house trainings and for other programs such as makerspace coding club etc so then the next fee schedule slide is just for the
42855,om-557-134927/2uGdmbASCeQ_DOT_mp3_00104.flac,14.74,-1,will tell us what our cost of service is and where fees should be and once we have that information we anticipate starting that after the beginning after mid year so we need to get through the new zoning ordinance process we need to get
42856,om-557-134927/2uGdmbASCeQ_DOT_mp3_00125.flac,9.84,-1,hard copies and and what we will do is convert those to electronic copies for them and that will cover our our cost to do that provide that service for them
42857,om-557-134924/JXxdkwWqTfY_DOT_mp3_00048.flac,14.88,-1,and only reason i'm concerned is is i'm not sure about the city's safety statistics but i know nationwide traffic fatalities and injuries are way up this year so it would seem like we want to make sure we're doing as much as we can to enforce these rules and i know we were
42858,om-557-134924/JXxdkwWqTfY_DOT_mp3_00141.flac,14.14,-1,to related training so the city is eligible to receive an allotment from the state specifically for nine hundred and eleven so that's it for the police grants fund and this last
42859,om-557-134924/JXxdkwWqTfY_DOT_mp3_00224.flac,14.8,-1,hopefully sooner than later or even immediately the second recommendation is that we increase to increase abandoned waste collection events from our current two zero to two five hundred that will bring us once again up to what we're seeing
42860,om-557-134924/JXxdkwWqTfY_DOT_mp3_00339.flac,14.71,-1,rate i don't think i understood this is there a line item for bulk item versus trash and recycling or is it just fifty bucks per unit or how does the bill generate well we we built as part of the contract
42861,om-557-134924/JXxdkwWqTfY_DOT_mp3_00378.flac,14.68,-1, just had a recent evaluation done an actual evaluation done that showed that we're about a hundred twenty nine thousand dollars underfunded and this takes in consideration that since the we did this plan when one of the three pensioners passed away so was three when the plan was
42862,om-557-134915/gufadEb7ZDM_DOT_mp3_00091.flac,14.92,-1,capital maintenance versus capital programs so if you're saying the maintenance budget is only one and a half and i think the last slide showed that the city match is looks like three to four million on the one
42863,om-557-134915/gufadEb7ZDM_DOT_mp3_00191.flac,14.59,-1,caltrans is funding some others so that's why we've got a good grant portion here i think some of this has gone to council recently and there's an exhibit they're showing but this is basically pedestrian safety improvements that are

44507,BF41015/BF_SPACE_4-10-15_DOT_mp3_00270.flac,13.71,-1, they are just annual license renewals so those are n ual why are they not already covered in the base of the initial eight thousand you were budgeted this year because they go up over time
44508,BF41015/BF_SPACE_4-10-15_DOT_mp3_00314.flac,14.95,-1,for grants so because these are really the keys that we're looking for support initiatives to reduce or eradicate threats to our sources implement the existing watershed management plans address specific threats and problems to result in
44509,BF41015/BF_SPACE_4-10-15_DOT_mp3_00523.flac,12.42,-1, so it's looking like we should make it through the year you know if it gets really really dry you never know but it seems that we're budgeting about right for electricity

44542,BCMolokaiPlanningCommission21115/BC_SPACE_Molokai_SPACE_Planning_SPACE_Commission_SPACE_2-11-15_DOT_mp3_00240.flac,14.86,-1,much would be kind of think we're right up against the deadline i mean we're going to miss the deadline if there's a deferral here but what i'm saying is it's unlikely
44543,BF150615/BF_150615_DOT_mp3_00129.flac,14.44,-1,is going to need to be revised to members of the staff has already worked on one area that i would ask you gentlemen to give us comment today because we have all received
44544,BF150615/BF_150615_DOT_mp3_00160.flac,14.92,-1,increases in premium amounts not in their salaries and we have included an adjustment in f y sixteen budget to cover those costs so i don't know where these are why these are included in the cost items
44545,BF41315/BF_SPACE_4-13-15_DOT_mp3_00024.flac,14.88,-1,things that were difficult and time consuming and expensive in as short amount of time really short response can you tell us what
44546,BF41315/BF_SPACE_4-13-15_DOT_mp3_00071.flac,14.76,-1,requested an additional appropriation into this year the auditors look at that as a significant source of just in case money really what that emergency fund is for to provide some stability we don't
44547,BF41315/BF_SPACE_4-13-15_DOT_mp3_00092.flac,14.98,-1,of this calendar year for the next session so everybody's kind of waiting for that report to come out before any changes so rose revenue for this year fiscal year two thousand and sixteen which will be the actual revenue
44548,BF41315/BF_SPACE_4-13-15_DOT_mp3_00218.flac,14.83,-1,can find maybe legislative remedies or they'd be at the county or state level on what type of insurance commercial paper or whatever it may be you know we already went through the fiasco with student

44550,BOS092815Title1/BOS_092815_title2_DOT_mp3_00070.flac,13.32,-1,about the other one whether or not that addresses all our concerns i don't know i don't know the point on that ok and in terms of well turns out there are option that you have in your presentation here of a new station
44551,BOS092815Title1/BOS_092815_title2_DOT_mp3_00128.flac,14.83,-1,necessary for anything any part of our lives it's certainly necessary for public transportation that makes sense that if we're going to not keep handicapped people locked in their houses they have to be able to get
44552,BOS092815Title1/BOS_092815_title2_DOT_mp3_00165.flac,14.89,-1,again the the thrust of this presentation was primarily waverley we reference belmont because we where we are fairly certain that in a few years big as we need to do repair and maintenance work at

44554,BOS072715Title1/BOS_072715_title1_DOT_mp3_00005.flac,14.95,-1,so what i suggest is why don't we go through our agenda we can begin and and then by the time we go into executive session we would have gone through the agenda so we don't have to open again to the public and keep
44555,BOS072715Title1/BOS_072715_title1_DOT_mp3_00054.flac,14.91,-1,development could sustain its terms of being able to adequately inspected oversee work and then also you know how much of an impact could the town itself sustain a four square miles in terms of being impacted by construction so
44556,BOS072715Title1/BOS_072715_title1_DOT_mp3_00103.flac,14.561,-1,same and basically come up with future recommendations either in terms of concepts or phasing or funding this process began in march of two thousand and fifteen there 
44557,BOS072715Title1/BOS_072715_title1_DOT_mp3_00174.flac,14.92,-1,point because we don't have any we don't have the capabilities of doing that and the requirements for the board of health would be an overhead fan and a ventilation system and a fire suppression system and in the building so we would take out a an old ice

44559,BOS061713/BOS_061713_DOT_mp3_00148.flac,14.8,-1,assumptions as they develop the statement so we've we've touched all the bases in terms of making sure we've used the rate that they have signed off on so that there won't be an issue down the road because some communities have gotten in trouble where they
44560,BOS052815CL19/BOS_052815-CL19_DOT_mp3_00107.flac,14.53,-1,plan so i'm all for beautification i say keep the original beautification plan we sacrificed a few trees we're supposed to get some more and i'm hoping that the town can commit to watering those trees because they'll be tiny

44927,BOSFeb11/BOSFeb11_DOT_mp3_00349.flac,14.94,-1,board should address the issue go forward simple as that you know my own take on it for what it's worth is that it's a tough law it's a very technical law i don't blame the council for making a mistake and tell me what to do it happens it just happened so you
44928,BOSJanuary152013/BOSJanuary152013_DOT_mp3_00007.flac,14.95,-1,thoughts together and summarize what's happened since the board authorized me to to meet with the craft organization just put some thoughts together sort of take a step back several months ago the town endeavored on a clearing house method of trying
44929,BOSJanuary152013/BOSJanuary152013_DOT_mp3_00077.flac,14.88,-1,mostly more on the saturday of the event as opposed to the friday both because of the smaller numbers that attend the friday show based on the last few years as well as the traffic flow and people not coming down to later
44930,BOSJanuary152013/BOSJanuary152013_DOT_mp3_00084.flac,15.0,-1,also just basic question on the application form it says five o'clock the event starts but someplace else has five thirty is it five thirty it's not there yet we are after the application we did we made a few modifications like think about what capping it

45203,CC20161011HHT/CC-2016-1011-HHT_DOT_mp3_00059.flac,14.67,-1,because you know we funded and then we go through all this and we wait and wait and wait and we have people that want jobs and we have jobs that need to be done but we're caught up in paperwork which to me makes no sense but anywhere near i'm not going to be able to change that

45208,CCBF020216/CC_BF_02-02-16_DOT_mp3_00188.flac,14.8,-1,little bit difficult to implement and there has been some hick ups and it's not something that was easily implemented as you'll see in the budget deliberations we had with the change everybody's index codes

45211,CC20161018EAR/CC-2016-1018-EAR_DOT_mp3_00141.flac,14.26,-1,deadline for certain like if it's over five consecutive days type events a certain deadline in which they have to submit the application and if the past that deadline then

45215,CCBF101315/CC_BF_10-13-15_DOT_mp3_00021.flac,14.76,-1, fair amount of time because it does represent a lot of change within the department deputy director and i is leading the effort and identified this is a potential source of funds and a large sum of funds you know in terms of our budgets 
45216,CCBF101315/CC_BF_10-13-15_DOT_mp3_00123.flac,14.98,-1,officers that's the state procurement officers interpretation i could see how it could be open to a broader interpretation again though if we were to give an opinion that

45227,om-557-136671/h0_g3zyBEr0_DOT_mp3_00270.flac,14.92,-1,bikes crashes is all falling well below this but putting all of this aside what it really means is traffic operations would not be improved we'd be looking at potentially higher crashes higher risk of
45228,om-557-136671/h0_g3zyBEr0_DOT_mp3_00521.flac,14.71,-1,signal without a back up plan well why don't we could have two motions we could vote on the first one and then also do a motion on the second one and they would know what how the committee voted on the two i knew i knew that
45229,om-557-136671/h0_g3zyBEr0_DOT_mp3_00566.flac,5.55,-1,from either committee all right yes
45230,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00033.flac,8.88,-1,this problem but when you know we've got twelve zero riders a year it's difficult to continue to support a service we're really highly subsidizing that service
45231,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00148.flac,14.83,-1,obviously that's that's just my comments to my suggestion i think this looks very well designed and i hope maybe with the addition of a crosswalk marking and i would love if maybe as a means of saving on paint maintenance
45232,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00223.flac,14.65,-1,mentioned before because the existing mason street road is wider and it would need to narrow to come to a narrower bridge width that we are striving for to try and find a balanced project here now the bridge
45233,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00227.flac,14.92,-1,a three foot issue for the bridge with we are receptive to having a narrower very rail if that makes sense but the barrier rail has to be crash resistant for vehicles up to a height of thirty two inches so
45234,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00308.flac,15.0,-1,there is criteria that we would need to be evaluated in our final design so staff is is honestly trying to accommodate the desires of the narrowest bridge feasible we just need to ensure that it does meet the standards so that a
45235,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00310.flac,14.65,-1, there wouldn't be parking what i was getting to is that there is a net loss of parking in the project because the the new bridge is going to be wider and there is the narrowing of kimberly on this side i'm sorry
45236,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00322.flac,14.89,-1,a dead end there's no way for them to cross the street so they have to go back and you get the other end there's not a sidewalk on the other side of the street right sorry i wasn't clear yeah i'm not clear obviously we should fill in sidewalk and everywhere we don't have a sidewalk i'm what i'm wondering is
45237,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00387.flac,14.32,-1,about outreach to the neighborhood and i mean it sounds like there was no noticing yet to the neighborhood about these plans and i'm just hoping that there will be a way for the neighborhood to comment and
45238,om-557-136680/5_gdYcFpubU_DOT_mp3_00403.flac,14.71,-1,master plan many many hours were were used to produce that document and i think it's very important that we uphold what previous people have done in the past for the city and have
45239,om-557-135938/aj0Z9XIfs8I_DOT_mp3_00222.flac,14.14,-1,here if there's a slider where we can show look it made a difference and we don't have to just average over ten years and that's the only thing we look at and i think we're gonna see some some good things out of that the
45240,om-557-135938/aj0Z9XIfs8I_DOT_mp3_00563.flac,14.92,-1,comparison shop and download all these apps and see which works best and where they have them we're just like forget it i'll just walk or take the bus so to me narrowing it down to one or two vendors is is important i think having more than one but having to be it
45241,om-557-136666/i2FQ_vKePBw_DOT_mp3_00040.flac,14.76,-1,any any input that brown might have about how the lot is run and how people can participate in this program but this service goes as you can see figueroa korea and to the extent of castillo and santa barbara

45247,om-557-136666/i2FQ_vKePBw_DOT_mp3_00455.flac,14.83,-1,blackerby i what i'm wondering is it could we select a vice chair today and at any point that person i mean throughout the year if they decide that they don't want to do anymore or can't we can
