1,20170613-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170613-10:11:09_17,,there. i look forward to continuing to work with you on the effort sharing proposal and bringing it to a successful conclusion with your support.
2,20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_2,,we all agreed at the last session in strasbourg that development is important but we need to remember it now when we are talking about the financial contributions.
3,20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_8,,we need to invest in enablers of development and yes most of all we need to invest in good governance.
4,20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_11,,they are ready to give thousands of euros to traffickers because there is not good governance.
5,20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_10,,many migrants are not even extremely poor but they are all extremely desperate.
6,20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_9,,if we get back for example to the issue of migration we will see that this is the key question the question of governance.
7,20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_1,,poverty war and also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people undertake dangerous journeys in the search for a better life in europe and development cooperation is an important part of the answer to this challenge.
8,20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_7,,in all these efforts ahead of the thirteenth national conference in addis ababa we need to be aware of the fact that finance alone will not be sufficient. policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals. we need policies that will ensure that financial resources are used effectively and in areas that will bring further mobilisation of resources and sustainable development.
9,20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_5,,furthermore we need a completely new approach to financing development.
10,20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:06:22_13,,this is the first regulatory act which will provide police in all member states with their common rules.
11,20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_1,,i suppose and i am sure that it is not the end of the discussion or even the beginning of the discussion because it is a very complicated package and i do not think that all of our members have read the full package.
12,20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_10,,we have to be ready for that.
13,20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_11,,this does not mean that we have to be technologically ahead of technology. we have to be very firm on our principal ground it is the fundamental right of people to be people people first with technology for people.
14,20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-16:26:52_8,,nanotechnology is ahead of us.
15,20170214-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170214-23:13:56_1,,was one of the reasons that brought us to the financial crisis.
16,20090204-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20090204-18:30:04_3,,could we not do more and could you perhaps be more specific about what has been done so far? what are your aims?
17,20110117-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110117-22:45:45_0,,mr president i also want to raise the issue of respect for religious freedom for all without discrimination because this is a basic human right.
18,20171212-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20171212-11:43:32_9,,efsi also contributes to the cop twenty one objectives to keep sustainable development and environment objectives in mind. efsi also increases the local presence level through the reinforcing of the european investment advisory hub.
19,20170704-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170704-10:49:44_8,,we all know that some member states will do their best to weaken this legislation.
20,20170704-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170704-11:31:41_10,,we took many measures to improve the situation and i believe we achieved certain improvements.
21,20171129-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171129-18:52:34_5,,with climate change bringing more extreme weather events we need to be able to protect human lives and valuable assets and to make our regions our cities and our towns more resilient.
22,20141021-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141021-17:48:50_3,,as for energy three years ago the eu heads of government decided to set the current year two thousand and fourteen as a clear deadline for the completion of an internal energy market.
23,20141021-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20141021-17:48:50_5,,well all is on track. the commission action plans have been published and updated.
24,20171002-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171002-19:45:50_2,,parliament also says clearly that it urges the member states which are absent here not to impose any obligation on encryption providers that would result in the weakening or compromising of the security of their networks or services such as the creation or facilitation of back doors'.
25,20120201-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120201-20:10:03_1,,for the eu the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and inclusive electoral process and to be prepared for a range of scenarios.
26,20120201-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120201-20:10:03_2,,but we should not lose sight of the big picture.
27,20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_1,,the irish system works within a legal and regulatory policy directive framework dictated by the eu.
28,20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_4,,ireland is no worse or better than any other place. i object to hostile comments about ireland emanating from london new york and the german media.
29,20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_5,,all these places have experienced regulatory and banking challenges and problems equal to and in many cases far worse than those we have faced in ireland.
30,20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_6,,the constant sniping from some of our eu neighbours has been based on prejudice rather than objective fact and does little for eu solidarity at a time when europe is going through enormous financial and economic challenges.
31,20140114-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20140114-19:05:37_0,,thank you very much for the question.
32,20120611-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20120611-20:08:06_2,,raising funds for research and care addressing discrimination at work and advocating policy change by decision makers all depend on prior awareness and understanding of multiple sclerosis.
33,20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_10,,our choice tomorrow is to go for a strong mandate with a ban and go for negotiations or go for negotiations using our mandate as a starting point and end up with something meaningless.
34,20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_5,,in exchange we got the protection of the vulnerable marine ecosystems.
35,20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_7,,and yet one month after we adopted our compromise the council did not put it on the agenda did not even present it. i used this time to talk to the member states and the presidencies.
36,20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_9,,if this compromise is further watered down it will become meaningless.
37,20180228-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180228-17:14:28_3,,if you want to change the rules in parliament on the balance of the countries you have to change it first in the council and then we will see. finally i fully understand the position of the council in the spitzenkandidaten issue but they also have to understand ours because we have to approve
38,20180228-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20180228-17:14:28_4,,the candidate we have to approve their programme and we have to approve the college.
39,20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_25,,cases. finally you were in the us last week. i hope you had interesting meetings.
40,20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_23,,you. would you have updates to give us today on the shopping antitrust
41,20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_9,,in this report we strongly support the independence of the commission and the national competition authorities.
42,20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_3,,the first time was with commissioner almunia in.
43,20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_5,,as you know this is a nonbinding report but it sends a strong political message to the commission.
44,20180418-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180418-21:09:22_4,,two thousand and thirteen this may be the last competition report of this term. next year we will have european elections again.
45,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_22,,yet the importance of our partnership with the eib and with the european union in meeting our commitments both to our shareholders and to our countries of operations is clearer than ever.
46,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_13,,second under the aegis of the european union new structures of cooperation between ebrd and eib offer great new opportunities for us to work together.
47,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_15,,these initiatives facilitated by ec funds bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and as such offer an excellent crucible in which to forge the development of our joint work.
48,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_11,,with this wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and cooperation mechanisms to do so. and we see as we saw last august when faced with the conflict driven banking crisis in georgia
49,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_17,,third i take the european parliament's views as welcome input to the early stages of the ebrd's fourth capital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in zagreb in may.
50,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_4,,faced with the dramatic decline in private flows of credit we came together last month with the world bank group to launch the joint ifi action plan in support of banking systems and lending to the real economy in central and eastern europe.
51,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_19,,an increase of more than.
52,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_2,,first the context of the financial and economic crisis renders any encouragement of greater cooperation between ebrd and eib more relevant than ever.
53,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_20,,twenty at the same time we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing.
54,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_18,,two thousand and ten the ebrd has taken a proactive stance in response to the crisis supporting our clients in countries of operations we are expanding our instruments and aim to invest eur seven billion in two thousand and nine
55,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_3,,yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy driven aspiration but a vital necessity.
56,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_21,,the full implications of the current situation on our portfolio and on the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen.
57,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_16,,i believe it is in this context that we may find divisions of labour applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation including common standards which you have called for.
58,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_12,,that this kind of ifi cooperation born of need is the kind that works best.
59,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_14,,i refer in particular to the western balkans investment framework now being launched as well as to the eastern partnership announced by the european council in recent days which will build on the good cooperation we have already established through our memorandum of understanding and the neighbourhood investment facility.
60,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_7,,the action plan recognises that an effective crisis response in europe's integrated financial markets requires fast and coordinated action by all stakeholders parent banks which own a large part of the region's financial sectors;
61,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_0,,mr president what worries me most is the suggestion that the european investment bank has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis that it can somehow act as the europe wide body to provide stimulus where member states have singularly failed to coordinate their own stimuli.
62,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_4,,i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks.
63,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_2,,the eib has a leverage of about thirty five times and its shareholders are member state governments.
64,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_3,,it would be a serious issue if it were to go bust like some of our commercial banks. the report even encourages the eib and the commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments.
65,20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_1,,the danger is that if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested then its enviable high credit rating may be downgraded like some of our governments.
66,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_17,,however i would stress that the commission has neither the capacity nor the desire to lead the delivery of the action plan itself.
67,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_11,,the implementation of an action plan will require real cooperation commitment and leadership from member states and regional stakeholders to deliver the eighty or so projects included at this stage.
68,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_9,,this rapid progress is important if we are to maintain momentum as we enter the implementation phase of the strategy.
69,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_19,,this is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the member states and other stakeholders.
70,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_26,,the commission very much expects parliament to be actively involved in events such as the annual forum.
71,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_22,,the first formal assessment of progress made will be presented under the polish presidency in the second half of.
72,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_24,,this will give all stakeholders an opportunity to consider how the first months of the strategy have gone and what lessons might already be drawn at that stage.
73,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_15,,the coordination monitoring and reporting is done by the commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the member states or organisations of the baltic sea region.
74,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_13,,i would now like to say a few words about the planned governance system which is proposed for the operational implementation of the strategy.
75,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_14,,this is one area where there has been much discussion among the member states but the overall approach is that policy orientations will be taken by the council.
76,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_4,,the baltic sea strategy has required a completely new approach from the european commission as it is the first time that we have prepared an integrated strategy for a group of member states who have to face the same challenges and who may benefit from the same opportunities.
77,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_12,,in financial terms although there is no additional financing from the eu budget the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and a more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the european investment bank or the nordic investment bank.
78,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_2,,of course it is not a complete surprise to me that parliament is taking such an interest in the strategy.
79,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_23,,two thousand and eleven however prior to that the first annual forum of the baltic sea strategy will take place next year.
80,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_25,,i would like to conclude by saying that i look forward to continuing to work closely with parliament on all aspects of strategy.
81,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_8,,the swedish presidency has led positive and constructive discussions in council which are to lead to conclusions already in october.
82,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_21,,here we expect to see a wave of coordination meetings to kick start the various priority areas and individual projects included in the action plan.
83,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_18,,responsibility must rest with the relevant member states and other stakeholders directly involved on the ground.
84,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_27,,your backing is crucial to maintain widespread visibility for the strategy to maintain high level political support for the strategy and to maintain pressure on the member states and the regional actors to deliver results.
85,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_16,,in addition the commission proposes to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties.
86,20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_10,,i would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparatory work on the strategic framework that i have just described will count for nought unless we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the ground hence the importance of the strategy's action plan which has also been drawn up during the preparatory work.
87,20180417-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180417-15:28:50_1,,the population of europe.
88,20180417-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180417-15:28:50_2,,the majority are fed up with mass migration. they do not want any more migrants and they want to send back those who are now here.
89,20180417-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180417-15:28:50_3,,we are on one side and on the other side there is the whole corrupt political elite. the thing is that the majority of the citizens of europe cannot really speak up because they are punished they are oppressed there are all these hate speech laws that silence people. it is really strange that we are the
90,20180417-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20180417-15:28:50_5,,we do have freedom of speech and we speak up for the majority of the citizens of europe but they should also speak up and they should support hungary in our efforts.
91,20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_0,,mr president could i say that the commissioner showed a good understanding of the construction industry.
92,20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_6,,i would emphasise the need for more ce marking which is absolutely essential. we do not want to see any more national standards and i wish this whole process every success for the future.
93,20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_1,,all i would say is that i think it represents a larger percentage of overall gdp something like twelve or thirteen and of materials say four or five so it is a very important sector. i am a civil engineer by background and it was a privilege to do the opinion on behalf of the

95,20090423-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20090423-21:41:42_5,,the construction industry does need a regulation after twenty years of having the directive in place.
96,20130311-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130311-18:14:05_1,,it is evident that gender equality must be mainstreamed in all policy responses to the crisis in all education and training policies in the european social fund and in other programmes so as to enable greater social integration through employment.
97,20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_12,,i have in mind a council with a wider mandate covering all economic social environmental and human development in the world.
98,20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_14,,now we should do the same in the european union.
99,20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_18,,i think that we should pay a lot of attention to development issues also in that report.
100,20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_2,,for me personally the most important achievements in this report are the recommendations on the substantial strengthening of the economic social environmental and developmental dimensions of the un system.
101,20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_4,,by developing it into a sustainable development council.
102,20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_0,,mr president my report includes several proposals for strengthening the role of the united nations system in global governance and for improving the possibilities of the european union and its member states to better achieve our foreign policy goals inside the system.
103,20151123-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151123-21:40:12_8,,these ideas got a lot of support in the negotiations but not enough in order to be accepted.

162,20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_4,,this means that we wish to finance adequately investments to spur growth and jobs for example through the european fund for strategic investments and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the still ongoing migration crisis and the related external policies.

169,20160913-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20160913-21:49:59_30,,in those areas that cannot be qualified as top political priorities in the current circumstances reductions in the proposal of the commission have been made in a careful fashion in order not to harm programmes that perform well and are coming up to speed.

315,20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_2,,we have just adopted an energy efficiency directive that will definitely also point us in the right direction.
316,20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_3,,but because this is a huge massive problem there needs to be a fundamental change in the way we consume and produce energy.
317,20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:35:01_6,,so we need to use what we have now and that is the ets system.
318,20130415-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20130415-17:45:36_1,,you probably know how busy we are.
319,20120911-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20120911-17:07:34_2,,four thousand days and nights nearly eleven years.
320,20090310-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090310-19:11:19_3,,i am a recent participant in the twitter' site and i have to say that i am more than surprised and impressed at how much information is on that site from the european union. it gives a huge amount of information and i would like to congratulate them on that.
321,20150429-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20150429-11:27:20_3,,i am sure that this quest for freedom is universal and that the eu has a moral obligation and a strategic interest to avoid more tragedies in the mediterranean by promoting peace security and the rule of law in a firmer and more assertive way in the countries of origin.

323,20150519-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150519-10:48:07_4,,we know that there is a shortage of skilled labour in this area. at the same time there are a lot of people who will lose their jobs and will need retraining.
324,20150519-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20150519-10:48:07_10,,we hope that we will go all together;
325,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-20:08:31_2,,the dsa must improve the framework for digital service providers to stimulate growth but it must also make the fight against illegal content more successful and it must improve transparency and oversight.
326,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-20:08:31_4,,either we develop ai based on our own values and with economic benefits or we end up using ai developed on other continents without those values and without a large part of the economic benefits.
327,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-20:08:31_5,,a strong riskbased approach offers the best way forward here. these challenges are difficult but i fully support the efforts of all the rapporteurs here today. we are not even close to a satisfying legal situation but these reports are an excellent start.
328,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_3,,and some people born in a different time like myself might want to go back to how it was before because it seems like a simpler time.
329,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_7,,the future will be more digital not less and it brings incredible progress that we as policymakers should embrace.
330,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_9,,also brings dangers that we cannot ignore anymore.
331,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_10,,let us be honest with each other colleagues. the eu has done more to regulate the online world than any other continent.
332,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_12,,over the past decades we have not followed up on illegal content and illegal activities online with the same rigour as we have illegal activities offline.
333,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_13,,we have not achieved any meaningful transparency over how algorithms push content to users on a massive scale.
334,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_14,,we have not grasped the impact of it on our democracies our culture and our fundamental rights.
335,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_15,,instead we have focused on voluntary cooperation which is good but not good enough.
336,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_16,,not nearly good enough.
337,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_18,,we cannot leave this to the private sector without oversight and enforcement. we must keep this in the public debate as a priority and we must regulate no matter how technical these files are.
338,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_19,,the difficult challenge before us is to find the balance between digital progress and respect for fundamental rights.
339,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_21,,the value of lawmaking is the real change it effects.
340,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_22,,if we start off with conflicting regulations and directives that undermine each other instead of complementing each other we have lost the battle before it starts.
341,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_23,,we must respect the scope of each digital file.
342,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_24,,secondly the fundamentals of the e commerce directive were great but its greatest issue was transparency.
343,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_25,,we must improve and enforce meaningful transparency and i call for a clear mandate from this parliament.
344,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_26,,thirdly we all agree on the importance of notice and action mechanisms to remove illegal content online but this places the burden almost entirely on users. we therefore should complement notice and action with clear and appropriate obligations to remove illegal content and it's the public authorities who should provide the funding to follow up on this.
345,20201019-0900-PLENARY-en_20201019-17:25:33_27,,finally i would like of course personally to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all my colleagues on the libe dsa report for their excellent cooperation.
346,20180116-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180116-10:45:18_1,,they established some priorities;

348,20180116-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20180116-10:45:18_6,,indeed education and culture have to do with civilisation.

350,20180530-0900-PLENARY-30-en_20180530-22:53:56_4,,let me outline briefly what the commission is already doing to improve its implementation.
351,20150910-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20150910-11:06:41_1,,we are worried by the deteriorating situation when it comes to respect for human rights persecution of political opponents and journalists is becoming a rule in this country full of contrast a country which is on the one hand incredibly rich in oil and diamonds and on the other hand has one of the highest rates of child mortality in the world.
352,20150910-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20150910-11:06:41_2,,it is the corrupt elites who are depriving the people of angola of their basic human rights access to healthcare food and education by stealing public money intended for basic social services. we are seriously concerned about the possible mismanagement of eu development funds by the local authorities and in this regard we are asking the commission to review the national indicative programme under the eleventh edf and to ensure that good governance respect for human rights and the fight against corruption are the main financing priorities for this fabulously rich country which suffers also from a fabulously corrupt elite.
353,20150910-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20150910-11:06:41_0,,mr president after decades of conflict and instability angola continues to face the major challenges of weak governance human rights abuses and widespread corruption.
354,20130313-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20130313-19:12:10_3,,however it should be a decision taken by the eu as a whole and of course coordinated with the us turkey and the arab league.
355,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_5,,it is important that facebook is not only relying on ads as they say is their business model but is also delivering for trust by delivering solutions and actions in the way of how they do their business model.
356,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_3,,but i would also agree it is very important to understand that there is a missing brick in this wall and that is the e privacy regulation.
357,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_8,,we need to get more rules in place especially also for consumer control to get connectivity across the platforms in order to have a choice.
358,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_6,,the business model of just earning money by using the data of individuals has to change because that's not only facebook's business model.
359,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_4,,we still need to fix that problem because the communication data needs to be protected in a specific way.
360,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_2,,we can be very proud as the european union and especially as parliament that we have a tool to protect the privacy and integrity of our citizens' lives with the gdpr in place.
361,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_2,,it's about fundamental rights privacy awareness but privacy enforcement as well namely the right to be forgotten enshrined by the gdpr.
362,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_3,,but it is also about democracy because fake news is a hybrid war of intoxication manipulation lies and hate speech aimed to weaken democracy through interfering in elections and enhancing populism and europhobia. so it takes a european response which means that no member state can do it on its own before a giant in the internet like facebook but also legal binding and effective law. but it takes action. that means that doing nothing is not a choice.
363,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_4,,that is what the european citizens are expecting from all of us and that is precisely and exactly what we ask from you.
364,20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-16:49:49_5,,the european commission must take initiative action and now.
365,20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_6,,upholding these values is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the european union because they guarantee that member states fulfil their international law obligations and that they can trust each other and the institutions of the european union.
366,20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_4,,the european union was founded on the principles of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights.
367,20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_12,,failing to do so may have severe consequences including the possibility of the european union falling apart. almost sixty years have passed since its foundation.
368,20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_10,,right before our eyes.
369,20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_3,,this report also has other important implications for the fundamental rights of minorities roma children women and lgbti people and for those seeking asylum.
370,20150907-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20150907-18:47:26_9,,this has been proved in the last couple of years and must be rectified. that is why in this report we call for a new mechanism that is automatically triggered in cases of breaches of fundamental values and rights to remedy the breaches to avoid the materialisation of systematic threats in member states. our common european fundamental values are being threatened first and foremost from within
371,20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_7,,too narrow a focus means that we will be missing some targets.
372,20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_8,,too many mandates at the same time can lead to fragmentation and to high costs.
373,20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_9,,we should keep finding the right balance and finding the tradeoffs to be focused and efficient in the work and the eib.
374,20110706-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20110706-18:21:36_2,,this can be done through various programmes and the exchange of best practices and know how and by assuring the availability of necessary funding for education training awareness raising and empowerment for women as well as for the continuous fight against gender violence stereotypes and discrimination.
375,20180118-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180118-15:31:41_3,,it is about jobs and it is about money.

377,20180118-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20180118-15:31:41_2,,it is about european citizens' trust in the european commission and institutions;
378,20180502-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180502-15:46:21_7,,let me give you a few examples.
379,20170911-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170911-21:13:53_0,,madam president i have listened carefully to the debate today and i am encouraged by the engagement of the members of this house.
380,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_9,,we need to speak about gender equality and we need to counteract racism xenophobia and islamophobia.
381,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_1,,i was in the arrivals hall waiting to go out through customs when we heard and felt the first explosion.
382,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_10,,no rifles or surveillance technology in the world can do that.
383,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_2,,then the second explosion came and some of us thought that the roof was coming down upon us.
384,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-15:50:02_4,,my body remembers that fear and it is in that feeling that i reject those who say that we have to learn to live with this. terrorism is manmade and we can undo it.
385,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_1,,it is time to step back for a moment to just pause and think through the implications of our actions until now.
386,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_2,,are we taking the right measures to invest massively in better equipment better cooperation between our police and security services and effective deradicalisation or are we still putting forward expensive but ineffective and symbolic measures of mass data collection or intrusive surveillance measures against completely innocent citizens
387,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_3,,thereby weakening effective security and our freedoms together which we defend?
388,20170315-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20170315-16:04:50_4,,therefore i am very happy that commissioner king is starting to investigate the effectiveness of the hundreds of security measures which the european union and its member states have adopted through the years.
389,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-11:36:19_3,,if this is what you are calling for then welcome back into europe.
390,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_3,,however the most offensive position that you have taken is the proposal that spain will have the right to veto any brexit deal over the issue of gibraltar.
391,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_5,,i do however have a solution to prevent gibraltar being used as a pawn in brexit negotiations and indeed end spanish claims once and for all. make gibraltar a fully integrated part of the uk;
392,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_9,,i have been calling for this for many many years and with the unique opportunities that brexit has given us i believe it is an idea whose time has come.
393,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_7,,give gibraltar real influence and a voice in westminster and send a clear message that gibraltar is not for sale.
394,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_6,,give her and our other overseas territories their own member of parliament.
395,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_8,,in this area we the uk can learn from our continental cousins because the french give representation to their overseas territories and i propose that we should too.
396,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_2,,this i guarantee would cause immense damage to the economies of the european union and would result in putting many of your citizens out of work. it is what we call in the uk cutting off your nose to spite your face.
397,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:34:25_4,,i want to make it clear in this chamber today that the people of gibraltar are proudly british. in two thousand and two ninety nine of gibraltarians voted in a referendum against shared sovereignty with spain and the wishes of the people should be upheld.
398,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-11:30:17_1,,first our position our attitude as committed pro europeans is very well described in hamlet when horatio describes the expression of the father of hamlet a countenance more in sorrow than in anger' that will be our attitude in our negotiation.
399,20170405-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170405-10:32:53_1,,i will just underline four ideas that seem to me of the utmost importance on the subject.
400,20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-21:01:48_5,,however it is a step that should not be taken lightly.
401,20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-19:18:18_3,,for me as an mep the effects of climate change on the rights of indigenous people are really very close to my heart because the warming climate is the direct or indirect cause of many of the violations against their rights.
402,20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-19:18:18_4,,we need to understand and be aware of that.
403,20121119-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20121119-21:10:43_2,,budget consolidation needs to be complemented by a social investment strategy that will address the social employment and education targets of the eu two thousand and twenty strategy.
404,20090423-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20090423-12:07:10_3,,not only have i had no answer but his office refused to respond to my e mails.
405,20131119-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20131119-20:04:13_5,,gender diversity on boards leads to more sustainable decisions and therefore to a more resistant european economy.
406,20090504-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20090504-22:11:56_6,,i would therefore like to stress again the importance of reaching first reading agreement on an issue which is so important to european union citizens.
407,20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_1,,estonia has chosen four main objectives for the next six months.
408,20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_2,,the logical order of these four objectives seems clear. the inclusive and sustainable europe that estonia wants to promote as the fourth objective will be closer if the first three objectives are achieved.
409,20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_4,,these three goals may certainly facilitate a more inclusive and sustainable europe.
410,20170705-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20170705-11:22:54_10,,i am confident and convinced that in the months to come estonia will go in the direction of denouncing any breach of fundamental rights in the european union.
411,20111213-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20111213-22:38:55_4,,i question the validity of reach to do so because so far we have not restricted one single substance using the reach system.
412,20111213-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20111213-22:38:55_5,,so that was my question if it is really appropriate and if it will work.
413,20120314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120314-15:57:49_2,,let me say that such a policy shift would be a strategic blunder. the eu should continue to do what it is doing only do it better.
414,20120314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120314-15:57:49_7,,therefore i would say that recent events in russia and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying the course in terms of our policy.
415,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:58:09_5,,iran sees some of its citizens as threats. repression happens to real people people with family and friends.
416,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:58:09_8,,so my question is basically what is the commission doing to prevent the execution of these innocent people who only dream of democracy and freedom?

418,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_11,,as coordinator for the jcpoa which we fully support and also as a diplomatic success from the european union i would ask you in the next eleven days and beyond to do your utmost best.
419,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_4,,i admit most rivals are dependent on who makes the decisions in the beginning of next year in washington but right now in the next couple of months we have an expiring weapons embargo and there is no movement from the usa to be expected which creates a daunting challenge i must say to try to restrain and limit arms sales to iran and here lies a task for europe. and i was very pleased to learn that a while ago that european efforts to restrain to limit or at least to delay arms sales to iran within the p fifty one framework
420,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_6,,any alternative means to find a solution is welcome because beijing will sell its arms.

422,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_9,,are talks with europe with beijing and moscow ongoing? can you assure me that we are doing everything that we can to restrain?
423,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_1,,the iranian foreign minister has welcomed it and eleven days from now like the islamic revolutionary guard corps has said a new phase in military cooperation between iran and the world will commence.

425,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:27:34_10,,is there still hope to limit arms sales?
426,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_1,,there is no way other than a peaceful solution out of this long ongoing conflict. international peace needs to be an international endeavour.
427,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_2,,it is therefore absolutely unacceptable that countries such as turkey for example contribute with mercenaries among other things to worsen the situation even more. the eu is a region built on the idea that dialogue is the only way forward for long lasting peace. it is our duty at the same time to take leadership for those ideas in our neighbouring countries.
428,20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-10:39:42_3,,i am glad that the international community is ready to assist and the eu needs to support the ongoing process in the osce.

430,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_9,,so yes in the beginning of this huge transition we will still need fossil fuels and therefore eu policies should support carbon capture enable government support schemes for blue hydrogen and i expect the commission to move forward in this direction in its energy summer package.
431,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_1,,no our biggest problem is that the perfect is becoming the enemy of the good.

433,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_3,,well altogether that is not a sustainable posture.
434,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_5,,but luckily there's one technology we all agree on that has the potential to decarbonise at least our heavy industries and transport hydrogen.

436,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_2,,and just look at the political debates no nuclear energy please no carbon capture that entails fossil fuels no biomass no gas in a transition no windmills in my backyard and no solar panels on agricultural grounds please.
437,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_4,,how can we possibly be serious in reaching our climate goals without technologies like carbon capture biomass or nuclear?
438,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_6,,it might not be a silver bullet but we all agree this energy carrier has enormous potential and our aim is clear to create a new clean produced green hydrogen market and a longterm certainty for all parties involved and that requires massive investments;
439,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-11:22:30_8,,if we want to pave the way for clean hydrogen we will initially need to invest in transitional technologies and these might not be perfect but they are good.

443,20201022-0900-PLENARY-en_20201022-10:48:45_5,,my second question is also why doesn't it include all the countries who have this kind of system in place referring to the infringement process of course.

453,20170314-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20170314-19:47:58_4,,that is evident from the recently leaked cables with one participant stating that it was impressive to see how some member states presented themselves outwardly as proponents of tax reform and at the same time to watch in the code of conduct group how they actually behave in eu discussions protected by confidentiality.

457,20170315-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170315-22:06:27_2,,i believe our response has to be ever more visible and strong engagement in the region to support those forces that fight for human rights and the rule of law.

465,20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_24,,i think the fast track the commission and parliament are now attributing is an achievement because its bottom up.
466,20181211-0900-PLENARY-en_20181211-23:14:09_22,,a second issue which is important and also an achievement for parliament is that we are reflecting on the fact that we are living in an ever changing innovation environment. it's new it's fast it's ambitious it's driven by vc capital and it's competitive.

523,20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_4,,we have seen record activity on the part of the commission in terms of dealing with hardcore cartels we have seen the development of the leniency system we have seen record fines put into operation by the commission and we have seen record activity in terms of mergers and state aid notifications as well.
524,20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_10,,however i mention the change of context because of course we all recognise that since the reports were published by the commission the commission's work in terms of state aid particularly has really taken on a rather different dimension.
525,20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_12,,it is very important and our report says so that in addressing those matters we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective open market.

529,20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_1,,in this case because of timing factors the reports for two thousand and six and two thousand and seven have been brought together but taking up one of the points mentioned by commissioner barrot a little earlier it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather markedly since we in fact began the exercise of considering the report some time ago.
530,20090309-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20090309-22:47:42_7,,our committee has drawn attention to two specific concerns what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers particularly in relation to food retailing.

566,20090422-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20090422-21:33:05_6,,i think the commission needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with the right proposal one that is not just about supporting performers and artists but that in real and practical terms will deliver precisely that.

829,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_14,,therefore it is crucial that the two unfulfilled anti corruption measures will be part of the new conditions.
830,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_6,,this memorandum sets out the supporting policy measures which are conditional for the disbursements of the funds.
831,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_12,,that being said to address any doubts that may arise during this debate the mfa is not an unconditional support.
832,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_8,,first the worsening conflict and casualties in the east of ukraine and all the many socio economic consequences of this aggression.
833,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_9,,second the economic recovery which remains fragile.
834,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_15,,if corruption is not addressed drastically mfa funds should not be delivered to ukraine.
835,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_7,,in that context i would like to highlight three key elements.
836,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_13,,there are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve economic stabilisation and support the reforms. it is very important to remind that the commission cancelled the last tranche of the third mfa programme when some of ukraine's commitments were not fulfilled.
837,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_17,,in addition the newly adopted law was signed yesterday by the president of ukraine. the rapporteur welcomes this news with great satisfaction it means that ukrainians take the commitment seriously.
838,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_5,,the assistance is also intended to trigger reforms in ukraine which is done by agreeing with the ukrainian authorities a memorandum of understanding.
839,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_11,,hence the need for support for these reforms in the context where many interests can play against especially in pre election years.
840,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_3,,in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation. this is the fourth time that the commission proposes macrofinancial assistance for ukraine since the beginning of the war in.
841,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_19,,if we are serious about our goal we cannot slow down the procedures.
842,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_1,,i am very grateful that we are where we are now. indeed ukraine needs this support and it deserves this support and it is very appropriate to have this next programme now.
843,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_7,,i am grateful to the commissioner that you although it is not included in the joint declaration explicitly referred to that because that is what it is also about.
844,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_8,,we need to be very clear in this regard.
845,20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-21:23:51_2,,however the eternally crucial issue remains that of the implementation.
846,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_0,,mr president you can't save your money and spend it you can't have you cake and eat it and you can't pretend to be a nation when you are not.
847,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_5,,the european union despite what it likes to think is not a nation.
848,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_6,,it follows that it cannot be and should not be a party to such international agreements this one and many others.
849,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_8,,happily we have the perfect opportunity to play it and play it repeatedly.
850,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_9,,we the united kingdom are permanent members of the united nations security council. we must not give this up. on the contrary we must start to make better use of it.
851,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_10,,this means using it to oppose block and even veto behaviour on international treaties conventions and agreements which are against our interest. there is a clear uk message here for the european union do you think you hold all the cards?
852,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_11,,you don't.
853,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_12,,our hand is potentially a lot better than you understand.
854,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_13,,what the uk has to do however is to understand itself how good our hand is and then be prepared to use it.
855,20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_14,,if the british government is worth anything at all those who play hardball with us should and i hope will find that we can play hardball with them.
856,20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:00:53_1,,it could form the blueprint for radical change without decreasing the funding going to newer member states. i have called on the uk government to include these open europe proposals in its reform and renegotiation discussions. after all we are talking about a third of the eu's total budget.
857,20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:03:25_0,,that is quite difficult to explain briefly but it is about not shuffling money around from one country to another and not particularly that large scale recipient countries give money to the commission that the commission then gives them back and tells them what to do.
858,20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:03:25_1,,rather it is focusing on countries like yours in situations like yours so that cohesion achieves sustainable economic growth and lifts people out of that situation for the benefit of everybody within the eu on a limited basis not forever.
859,20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_14,,it will be an unnecessary collection of much information about travellers who are completely innocent.

861,20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_7,,we are not fixing the system which is not working because some of the member states' authorities are not thoroughly working with the system and feeding information into it.

865,20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:27:02_1,,but at the same time you know that people are tired of words and promises and it is time for action from the commission as well. the strongest tool which you possess as a commission is the draft of your budget for the next multiannual financial framework. we should stop thinking about how to reduce the european budget
866,20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:27:02_2,,but look for own resources.
867,20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:27:02_3,,we should really focus on political priorities and the major priority is how to move from a europe of divergence and inequalities towards a europe of convergence strong economic growth and social justice.
868,20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:45:22_1,,this means that life for people in europe is better and that is what people expect from

870,20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_13,,in some cases a certificate of legality will only be a starting point the first measure included in the due diligence procedure.
871,20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_11,,firstly i would like to refer to the due diligence approach which is more comprehensive than just a certificate of legality.
872,20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_14,,where the risk assessment has shown that the country of origin presents a higher risk of administrative corruption or in countries where enforcement of national laws is weak additional guarantees are necessary to underpin the certified legality.
873,20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_12,,the principle of due diligence reflects the legal obligation of a proactive behaviour to a certain legality and needs to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be reasonably assured.
874,20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_3,,we should keep in mind that patterns of tropical deforestation are the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which vary in importance in different locations.
875,20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_5,,in the european union we understand that working on the coherence of our policies must go hand in hand with supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen national and local institutions and make progress towards effective governance and use of forest resources. i wish to thank again
876,20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_7,,i am encouraged that parliament while endorsing the approach of the commission wants to reinforce it further and has made amendments to this end.

890,20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_0,,mr president the international energy agency just recently published a report saying that the developed countries of this world the industrialised countries have about five years to change fundamentally the way they produce energy and the way they consume energy
891,20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_1,,in order for us to stay below a two degree increase in temperature.
892,20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_2,,now if we do not stay below two degrees we know what will happen.
893,20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_4,,then if we look at what has actually now been pledged by the same countries the countries that need to change fundamentally within five years it is unfortunately very unsatisfactory.
894,20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_5,,we see a situation now where the pledges are about half of what we need in order to reach our target.
895,20111115-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20111115-17:25:35_8,,we all know that we will not get a full legally binding agreement with regard to mitigation in durban that will solve these problems but we know also that we have possibilities to pursue targets that are ambitious nonetheless targets that will get us closer to our final goal.

991,20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-10:17:16_14,,so we are seeing improvements we are seeing positive effects already but we also realise that a lot has to be done.

1001,20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_20,,we also commend the hard work being done on the turkish side to improve the situation of the refugees they harbour they harbour millions there so it is a lot of work and also the legal safeguards and the legal position of those people has been improved by turkey which helps us enormously in making this agreement work and having a better solution than we had before.
1002,20160428-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160428-08:34:44_19,,so we are seeing improvements every day but we fully realise as member states and as the council that we are not there yet and a lot has to be done.

1042,20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_5,,this is combining help on one hand for emergencies as the commissioner said and prevention for the future.
1043,20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_4,,support for people and also for the future.
1044,20170705-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20170705-21:39:25_6,,there can be a combination of those tools.
1045,20180312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180312-21:47:46_1,,i think the biggest thing is that we are enabling things to happen.
1046,20180312-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180312-21:47:46_4,,we need to share info and for that we need all the platforms where we can easily share information and also where we can share the big data which is very important with the ict.
1047,20170517-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170517-15:31:36_5,,that should be understood.
1048,20170517-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170517-15:31:36_7,,it was an incredibly complicated time.
1049,20170517-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20170517-15:31:36_9,,so instead of blaming and criticising especially personally some people at the ecb we should appreciate what they did for the way our economy has got out of the crisis for the jobs they saved actually improving the situation in europe.
1050,20110406-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20110406-11:07:32_0,,mr president in may two thousand and ten parliament voted for the single market to be perceived as a holistic unified project finding an equilibrium between an open sme friendly economy and a citizen's social and basic rights.
1051,20180206-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180206-22:29:46_5,,however this proud place comes with responsibilities.
1052,20180206-0900-PLENARY-22-en_20180206-22:29:46_6,,we need to look further we need to address the major large scale political question as well.
1053,20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_15,,they haven't got a clue. they don't have a plan. they will continue giving billions of our money to the eu and are completely split on whether to carry out the result of the referendum or not.
1054,20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_9,,the tories have agreed to hand nearly gbp forty billion over to the eu as a punishment for having a democratic decision to leave.
1055,20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_14,,the tories have had two years to come up with a position on brexit and show us a blueprint of what an independent britain would look like.
1056,20180704-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20180704-20:25:31_5,,the recent commission statement of estimates showed that the uk will be handing over eur.
1057,20120329-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120329-10:32:56_1,,this citizens' charter would clearly outline citizens' rights and obligations within the single market especially for european citizens who want to move sell shop and work across borders. the urgent need for such an initiative was confirmed by the commission's study on citizens' top twenty concerns
1058,20120329-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120329-10:32:56_3,,the commission must now address these concerns by presenting the top twenty solutions as soon as possible to restore the crucial variable of credibility among citizens to the market.
1059,20120329-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20120329-10:32:56_4,,these measures would correct consumers' and smes' negative perceptions of the single market thereby boosting their participation in the market and reassuring the citizens that the eu works for them.
1060,20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_7,,there is no way out and if he says well perhaps a month or two later' i will not accept;
1061,20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_1,,the situation in the drc is indeed terrible and it has been this way for quite a while and i am deeply concerned about the handling of the current issue with regard to the kasai province.
1062,20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_6,,prepare the elections properly.
1063,20170613-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20170613-18:48:07_8,,i think we should not accept anything unless there's really a broad consensus with all political stakeholders.
1064,20150114-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20150114-20:00:54_3,,i would like to see the high representative despite her comprehensive explanations and the commission take on an even more prominent role.
1065,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_9,,and of course we took the decision in september two thousand and fifteen for the package of about eur four hundred and twenty million and of course it was done to directly support farmers and to see how we can leverage the supply and demand. member states and commissioner hogan will probably say something about it
1066,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_7,,it is also clear that it should be a joint effort a joint effort by the council the european parliament the european commission but also by the producers themselves.
1067,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_1,,the situation in the agricultural markets in many of the member states is very difficult and severe especially in the dairy sector and the council is fully aware of this situation and shares the concerns of the farmers who have to cope with these difficult problems.
1068,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_16,,that will be on the agenda of the june council to be discussed by the council member states and the commission.
1069,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_10,,are still implementing those measures.
1070,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_12,,in march we took sixteen additional measures together with the commission and the council and those measures relate to intervention measures they relate to promotion measures to exports as well as the possibility for member states to give additional state aid.
1071,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_17,,but also at the last council it was clear that many member states have stated that if we are again going to take additional measures they have to be linked to a reduction of milk production.
1072,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-08:37:54_6,,you see an average increase of milk production of about between five and six but that is not the case in every member state so whilst stating that we need a european answer at the same time we need flexibility for the member states to implement measures which are suitable for the national circumstances.
1073,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_0,,mr president i would like to thank all the members of parliament for their remarks but also for their suggestions and certainly the presidency will take them with us to our next discussion in the council of june because there we are going to discuss again the very severe situation in the dairy sector as well as the need for additional measures.
1074,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_1,,i would like to reiterate what was said by commissioner hogan that the commission and the council were not resting on their laurels.
1075,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_2,,many measures have been taken not only in september but also in march and of course we see some effects of those measures perhaps not enough but there are effects of those measures and the situation could have been worse if we did not have taken those measures.
1076,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_3,,and yes i would like to reiterate that we need a european approach.
1077,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_7,,and it is clear that the council also stated that we do not want to go back to a quota system. i agree with what was said by mr huitema that we have to improve the situation of the farmers in the supply chain.
1078,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_8,,we have to give them a fair price for their products.
1079,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_9,,therefore the work of the market taskforce installed by the european commission is so important and in the june council we have the first report of this taskforce and hopefully we get some interesting and creative ideas.
1080,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_11,,but at the same time of course we have to support those farmers and see how we can help them balancing supply and demand.
1081,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_13,,it is not the dutch model of the dutch government but it is also the dutch model of the dutch dairy producers and they are looking into niche markets into improving quality into new market concepts.
1082,20160526-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160526-10:18:50_14,,but they are also now at this moment discussing possibilities of reduction of the milk production in the netherlands on a voluntary basis and i think it is up to the council in june to see how we can support those initiatives of farmers' organisations to reduce the milk production.
1083,20180416-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180416-21:37:08_2,,that's always appreciated and i believe we have come up with a good report.
1084,20180416-0900-PLENARY-21-en_20180416-21:37:08_10,,because the patronising attitude that we've had in the past has made us look second or third in line in terms of preference of many recipient states and that effects the notional validity of the partnership was well.
1085,20091123-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20091123-20:32:52_2,,in one of my amendments and supported by the rapporteur refers to the fact that member states europol and eurojust are not granted the possibility to communicate data to non member states and third countries because of the absence of sufficient data protection in those countries.
1086,20091123-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20091123-20:32:52_3,,in my opinion the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services' requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analyses of the information contained in the system.
1087,20091123-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20091123-20:32:52_4,,the review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control procedures of the customs administrations due to the joint automated information system which will assist in preventing investigating and prosecuting serious contraventions of national laws.
1088,20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_1,,sometimes i have the feeling that there is a little too much of this innovative energy. we in the green group believe that the report is an important one; the aim of it is a very legitimate and crucial one for the time.
1089,20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_2,,had it been about unleashing the full potential of the lisbon treaty in the field of security and defence we would have been in full support.
1090,20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_7,,it would be an agency without transparency parliamentary oversight let alone control. we are in full support of centralisation; it makes sense in this field but not in this way without any accountability whatsoever.
1091,20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_8,,secondly we believe that before committing large amounts of fresh money to defence and security we should explore the full potential of efficiency gains through cooperation and only after this should we consider additional funding that might be available through the european union budget or from member states.
1092,20170315-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20170315-19:17:51_9,,these are the main reasons why our group is unable to support the report even though we are committed to a stronger european common defence and security policy and there are many very good ideas in the report in general.
1093,20160607-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20160607-10:19:11_1,,and aggressive fiscal planning.
1094,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_3,,they have the potential to enable us to solve many of the critical problems confronting us.
1095,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_11,,in order for it to be effective bridging the digital divide has to be mainstreamed into every other policy area in accordance with the united nations sustainable development goals.
1096,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_5,,digital technologies have huge potential in terms of reducing poverty increasing the competitiveness of the economy and creating employment opportunities.
1097,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_17,,the private sector needs to get involved and play a role through its expertise and innovation know how.
1098,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_9,,at the same time a huge increase in mobile services is securing across the planet and the numbers of mobile users are now surpassing the numbers of people having access to electricity sanitation or clean water.
1099,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_13,,in the european consensus on development which is a crucial document on development policy of the eu and its member states we can find the bold statement that they will continue to support information and communication technologies in developing countries as powerful enablers of inclusive growth and sustainable development.
1100,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_15,,we are all aware of the fact that in this area of developing cooperation public funding will not be sufficient for a truly transformative digitalisation process.
1101,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_7,,according to the two thousand and sixteen world development report on digital dividends six billion people lack access to high speed internet and four billion still have no internet access at all.
1102,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_12,,in order to realise these goals both developing countries and developed countries as well as all actors both public and private need to maximise and join their efforts.
1103,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_14,,special attention has been given to supporting digital literacy and skills to empower people especially women and people in vulnerable and marginalised situations to promote social inclusion and to facilitate the participation in democratic governance and the digital economy.
1104,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_6,,whereas digitisation is rapidly growing globally our partners from developing countries continue to lag behind losing the opportunity to fully utilise their human capital towards the achievement of the sustainable development goals.
1105,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_8,,at a time when digitisation is growing fast this lack of access is a major challenge to development as it continues to widen gaps and inequalities in the world.
1106,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_4,,if this potential is to be realised then we must find ways of turning these technologies into a resource for all people despite the challenges they face within their communities. what does it mean?
1107,20181112-0900-PLENARY-en_20181112-21:37:08_16,,for this very reason there is a need for public private cooperation based on development principles.
1108,20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_9,,it does not work and i very much hope that we can take away the last exemptions allowing airports and harbours and so on to use these inefficient methods that make people feel bad.
1109,20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_11,,so i think this report is important.
1110,20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_10,,and how can you say that you will have a high level of protection when people leave cds with twenty million people's data on them lying in cafs and when we know how easy it is to hack into computers? i did it myself as a kid actually.
1111,20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_4,,then you look at the anti terror legislation with profiling and you see it creates insecurity and it creates problems for people living their daily lives. you cannot combat terrorism with anti terror laws that create the same feelings of insecurity.
1112,20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_6,,we can see that it is neither efficient nor legal.
1113,20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_8,,the german surveillance scheme on eighteen forty year old muslim men in germany was not efficient.
1114,20090423-0900-PLENARY-27-en_20090423-22:47:45_12,,the council needs to adapt its logic and spend the resources efficiently targeting specific individuals and focusing the time on them instead of going for ethnic registration which is in complete violation of any human rights standards.
1115,20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_1,,this matter is extremely important because from europe we can make sure that the latest technology impacts on the usefulness and efficiency of road transport in all its forms.
1116,20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_5,,we need more data on the windscreens so that we can sort out our own salvations in a more effective and efficient manner.
1117,20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_4,,so often as elected members we journey round our constituencies and find ourselves in traffic jams and so often we have to make phone calls to find out what the situation is ahead.
1118,20090422-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20090422-23:01:25_6,,i wish mrs jensen and the commissioner every success.

1121,20170704-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170704-19:05:24_3,,sell it?
1122,20170704-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20170704-19:05:24_4,,this is the key point when we talk about cohesion.
1123,20170912-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170912-09:47:35_5,,this is exactly the moment when the governments should step in and some of them do but some of them do not.
1124,20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_2,,apart from that it does not make sense to repeat wrong things it does not make them more true.
1125,20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_4,,we will definitely not be financing military operations out of our budget in the future.
1126,20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_6,,rightly so this remains with the national budgets and with the national governments and parliaments. but we have to become more efficient.
1127,20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_7,,this exercise is primarily a more efficiency' exercise because if we plan together if we procure together if we train together that makes us more efficient in the tasks ahead.
1128,20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_9,,well in nato he could block everything if we had to rely on nato any veto from any member state would definitely block our access to nato resources.
1129,20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:52:32_10,,we need a certain amount of strategic and operational autonomy as the eu in order to be able to do what we deem appropriate.
1130,20171212-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20171212-18:23:04_5,,finally sanctions are part of efficient eu policies. i propose that we should make these more efficient targeting concrete individuals responsible for breaking international laws and human rights violations

1206,20090324-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090324-11:12:24_3,,i would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these monies have been to the rural areas of the north west where there are a lot of agricultural areas which are vital to the whole economy.

1217,20090324-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20090324-22:20:58_7,,i therefore agree with the rapporteur's approach urging the commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clones.

1395,20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_11,,the experience gathered so far at the global level shows that traderelated sanctions fall short of delivering the desired results.
1396,20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_13,,we do not see conclusive evidence that sanctions could lead to an improvement of the effectiveness and the implementation of the tsd chapters.
1397,20180116-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180116-20:56:23_15,,the way forward is to consolidate these chapters and to strive for the more effective and sustainable implementation of this important pillar in our valuebased trade policy.

1405,20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_6,,in that context i would like to highlight three key elements.
1406,20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_13,,if corruption is not addressed drastically mfa funds should not be delivered to ukraine.

1408,20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_7,,first the worsening conflict and casualties in the east of ukraine and all the many socio economic consequences of this aggression. second the economic recovery which remains fragile.
1409,20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_9,,hence the need for support for these reforms in the context where many interests can play against especially in pre election years.
1410,20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_19,,money but they will do so only when ukrainians manage to fulfil all the agreed and outstanding conditions.
1411,20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_11,,there are firm conditions to ensure that this money will serve economic stabilisation and support the reforms. it is very important to remind that the commission cancelled the last tranche of the third mfa programme when some of ukraine's commitments were not fulfilled.
1412,20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-20:44:15_3,,in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation. this is the fourth time that the commission proposes macrofinancial assistance for ukraine since the beginning of the war in. two thousand and fourteen this time the commission proposes eur one billion

1418,20180612-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180612-21:23:51_2,,however the eternally crucial issue remains that of the implementation.

1553,20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_8,,there was one main weakness however in that proposal which is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date. i believe that to be a major flaw.

1558,20090310-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090310-09:24:48_9,,that is why i proposed to the committee and the committee accepted an amendment stating that tyres that did not meet the standards after the implementation date should be sold off after twelve months.

1597,20090422-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20090422-10:01:07_4,,the fact is that the eu response to the financial crisis has been sluggish and minimalist.
