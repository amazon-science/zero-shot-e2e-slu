1794,20101215-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20101215-19:14:45_1,,an active and effective european union contributes to the overall security of the euro atlantic area.
1795,20180705-0900-PLENARY-en_20180705-10:32:09_5,,it is high time to consider personal accountability of moldova's officials.
1796,20201111-0900-PLENARY-en_20201111-20:40:48_1,,this is pretty straightforward.
1797,20201111-0900-PLENARY-en_20201111-20:31:22_1,,this alone would have well justified an increase in the budget for two thousand and twenty one but not only is the budget in decline but the sector is in difficulty and facing unprecedented crisis.
1798,20201111-0900-PLENARY-en_20201111-20:31:22_9,,only this could help equip the emff with the real strike for.

1800,20201111-0900-PLENARY-en_20201111-20:31:22_2,,the sector is suffering from the consequences of the massive drop in demand for fisheries and aquaculture product throughout europe.
1801,20180416-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20180416-23:20:41_1,,at the present moment there is no more important global issue than the preservation of peace.
1802,20180416-0900-PLENARY-25-en_20180416-23:20:41_2,,mankind is balancing on the edge of war.
1803,20180206-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180206-19:01:38_1,,but we must also set clear conditions. most important of all is the return of the rule of law and political freedoms and the re establishment of civilian rule over the military. it must also include a clear path to inclusive and fair elections in two thousand and eighteen which could also be observed by the european parliament. moreover
1804,20180206-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180206-19:01:38_4,,we have to show a brighter perspective for zimbabwe than other players especially china. we possess potentially strong tools and leverage when it comes to supporting zimbabwe's transition.
1805,20170913-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170913-12:56:06_0,,mr president thank you for giving me the opportunity to make my first speech here in the main plenary of the european parliament.
1806,20170913-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170913-12:56:06_2,,the european union has much to gain for india is a great country and i wish the european union well with those links.
1807,20170913-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170913-12:56:06_4,,we have both been members of the commonwealth for decades and we have cultural family and trading links that go back centuries.
1808,20151202-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20151202-17:41:06_3,,i wish to reiterate that frontex is one of our best agencies and the people who work for frontex are of the highest integrity.
1809,20100906-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20100906-22:12:42_1,,i would also like to particularly thank the rapporteur for this well documented report which allows the european parliament to reflect on the future revision.
1810,20100906-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20100906-22:12:42_4,,i would like to stress that the abolition of exequatur should constitute a real step forward in judicial integration; that the commission does not see this as the mere removal of a superfluous formality but as a step forward in the mutual trust in each other's judicial systems;
1811,20100906-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20100906-22:12:42_5,,and that as a result the existing refusal grounds should be reduced subject to appropriate safeguards.
1812,20100906-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20100906-22:12:42_6,,we welcome parliament's agreement that choice of court and arbitration agreement should be protected efficiently in the union.
1813,20100906-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20100906-22:12:42_7,,the commission will study the most appropriate means to achieve this objective in the union taking into account international conventions on the matter.
1814,20100906-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20100906-22:12:42_8,,may i indicate however that the protection of arbitration agreements should not limit the free circulation of judgments in the union.
1815,20100906-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20100906-22:12:42_10,,the commission invites parliament in the upcoming revision to open its position on this matter which really concerns access to justice in europe and the enforcement of rights granted by european union law.
1816,20100906-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20100906-22:12:42_14,,the commission intends to propose a revision of the regulation by the end of the year and it looks forward to cooperation with parliament for the first time on this matter.
1817,20091007-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20091007-15:38:32_1,,including development cooperation'.
1818,20090203-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090203-21:49:10_3,,as commissioner barrot has underlined in each individual country of the union there is a clear and more often than not official legal framework that ensures the protection of our cultural diversity.
1819,20090203-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090203-21:49:10_5,,real life examples show that solving issues related to education fuels strong community development.
1820,20090203-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090203-21:49:10_9,,where the need arises higher degree education in the language of minorities is part of the national educational system.
1821,20090203-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090203-21:49:10_13,,i would very much like to see a very substantial debate on how europe intends to take advantage of our unique educational system so that we remain united in our diversity.
1822,20131024-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20131024-12:02:51_0,,mr president in relation to the statement made about the staff who work for parliament parliamentarians accept responsibility for this house and we should never shift it to members of staff who cannot defend themselves.
1823,20131024-0900-PLENARY-10-en_20131024-12:04:29_1,,we need to delete the words in full' twice in this text to avoid misunderstanding as there may be a minor technical correction of the figures.
1824,20090422-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090422-15:41:22_4,,the second reason is interinstitutional equilibrium.
1825,20090422-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090422-15:41:22_6,,this is the democratic principle and this is what we are about to do.
1826,20090422-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090422-15:41:22_7,,so we are not saying we want to do something else.
1827,20090422-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090422-15:41:22_8,,we are saying we want to do our duty.
1828,20090422-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090422-15:41:22_10,,it is a much more important common policy and we cannot from the outset say that parliament will not have a bearing on that policy at all.
1829,20090422-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20090422-15:41:22_12,,the last and probably the most important point is transparency vis vis the citizens. our role as a parliament is accountability vis vis the citizens. we cannot and we must not say to the citizens that the big common policies like the external and defence policy will lie outside the democratic control of our parliament.
1830,20141021-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20141021-21:15:02_0,,madam president we must constantly keep in mind that as members of the european union we have signed up to a core set of democratic principles and rights.
1831,20141021-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20141021-21:15:02_1,,we must all operate under an umbrella of respect for democracy and the rule of law.
1832,20141021-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20141021-21:15:02_4,,yet very little is achieved through lecturing one another. far more progress can be made through a dialogue which is constructive and cooperative.
1833,20141021-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20141021-21:15:02_5,,more will always be achieved by offering solutions not just criticisms.
1834,20141021-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20141021-21:15:02_7,,this house is entitled to all of its varied and many opinions but i personally believe as a lawyer that alleged wrongdoings should be examined with a clear mind and always with fairness and respect.
1835,20141021-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20141021-21:15:02_8,,we here should be a platform for examination debate and most of all for solutions but it is not the european union's function to be both judge and jury in this matter.
1836,20090203-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20090203-12:50:57_0,,mr president thank you for your patience and indulgence.
1837,20120612-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20120612-20:46:56_3,,thank you very much for being here with us!
1838,20100617-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20100617-11:23:38_2,,a large part of the reason is of course illegal fishing more often than not by vessels which are registered to countries which lack the will or the resources to enforce international agreements. no amount of traceability measures or extra paperwork will address the problem of reducing
1839,20100617-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20100617-11:23:38_3,,fish stocks if so many vessels are still operating illegally and with impunity.
1840,20100617-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20100617-11:23:38_4,,the commission must therefore put pressure on the eu member states to end the practice which allows foreign vessels to register easily and operate under their flags.
1841,20100617-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20100617-11:23:38_5,,it is of no benefit to member states to turn a blind eye to illegal fishing.
