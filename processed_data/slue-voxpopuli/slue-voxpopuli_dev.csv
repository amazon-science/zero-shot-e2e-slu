2,dev/20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_2,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'strasbourg'}],we all agreed at the last session in strasbourg that development is important but we need to remember it now when we are talking about the financial contributions.
3,dev/20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_8,[],we need to invest in enablers of development and yes most of all we need to invest in good governance.

5,dev/20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_10,[],many migrants are not even extremely poor but they are all extremely desperate.
6,dev/20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_9,[],if we get back for example to the issue of migration we will see that this is the key question the question of governance.
7,dev/20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_1,[{'type': 'loc'| 'filler': 'europe'}],poverty war and also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people undertake dangerous journeys in the search for a better life in europe and development cooperation is an important part of the answer to this challenge.
8,dev/20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_7,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'addis ababa'}| {'type': 'event'| 'filler': 'thirteenth national conference'}],in all these efforts ahead of the thirteenth national conference in addis ababa we need to be aware of the fact that finance alone will not be sufficient. policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals. we need policies that will ensure that financial resources are used effectively and in areas that will bring further mobilisation of resources and sustainable development.
9,dev/20150518-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20150518-18:48:27_5,[],furthermore we need a completely new approach to financing development.

16,dev/20090204-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20090204-18:30:04_3,[],could we not do more and could you perhaps be more specific about what has been done so far? what are your aims?
17,dev/20110117-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20110117-22:45:45_0,[],mr president i also want to raise the issue of respect for religious freedom for all without discrimination because this is a basic human right.

20,dev/20170704-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20170704-11:31:41_10,[],we took many measures to improve the situation and i believe we achieved certain improvements.
21,dev/20171129-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20171129-18:52:34_5,[],with climate change bringing more extreme weather events we need to be able to protect human lives and valuable assets and to make our regions our cities and our towns more resilient.

25,dev/20120201-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120201-20:10:03_1,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],for the eu the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and inclusive electoral process and to be prepared for a range of scenarios.
26,dev/20120201-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20120201-20:10:03_2,[],but we should not lose sight of the big picture.
27,dev/20090323-0900-PLENARY-8-en_20090323-17:13:31_1,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}| {'type': 'norp'| 'filler': 'irish'}],the irish system works within a legal and regulatory policy directive framework dictated by the eu.

31,dev/20140114-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20140114-19:05:37_0,[],thank you very much for the question.

33,dev/20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_10,[],our choice tomorrow is to go for a strong mandate with a ban and go for negotiations or go for negotiations using our mandate as a starting point and end up with something meaningless.
34,dev/20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_5,[],in exchange we got the protection of the vulnerable marine ecosystems.
35,dev/20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_7,[{'type': 'date'| 'filler': 'one month'}],and yet one month after we adopted our compromise the council did not put it on the agenda did not even present it. i used this time to talk to the member states and the presidencies.
36,dev/20131209-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20131209-19:07:30_9,[],if this compromise is further watered down it will become meaningless.

46,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_13,[{'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'eib'}| {'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'ebrd'}| {'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'european union'}| {'type': 'ordinal'| 'filler': 'second'}],second under the aegis of the european union new structures of cooperation between ebrd and eib offer great new opportunities for us to work together.
47,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_15,[{'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'ec'}],these initiatives facilitated by ec funds bring us together to work concretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and as such offer an excellent crucible in which to forge the development of our joint work.

55,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_3,[],yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy driven aspiration but a vital necessity.
56,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_21,[],the full implications of the current situation on our portfolio and on the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen.
57,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_16,[],i believe it is in this context that we may find divisions of labour applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation including common standards which you have called for.
58,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:57:37_12,[],that this kind of ifi cooperation born of need is the kind that works best.

62,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_4,[],i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks.

64,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_3,[{'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'eib'}],it would be a serious issue if it were to go bust like some of our commercial banks. the report even encourages the eib and the commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments.
65,dev/20090324-0900-PLENARY-9-en_20090324-16:47:54_1,[],the danger is that if it expands its activities too far into supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested then its enviable high credit rating may be downgraded like some of our governments.
66,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_17,[],however i would stress that the commission has neither the capacity nor the desire to lead the delivery of the action plan itself.
67,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_11,[{'type': 'cardinal'| 'filler': 'eighty'}],the implementation of an action plan will require real cooperation commitment and leadership from member states and regional stakeholders to deliver the eighty or so projects included at this stage.
68,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_9,[],this rapid progress is important if we are to maintain momentum as we enter the implementation phase of the strategy.
69,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_19,[],this is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the member states and other stakeholders.

73,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_15,[{'type': 'loc'| 'filler': 'baltic sea'}],the coordination monitoring and reporting is done by the commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the member states or organisations of the baltic sea region.
74,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_13,[],i would now like to say a few words about the planned governance system which is proposed for the operational implementation of the strategy.

76,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_4,[{'type': 'ordinal'| 'filler': 'first'}| {'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'european commission'}| {'type': 'law'| 'filler': 'baltic sea strategy'}],the baltic sea strategy has required a completely new approach from the european commission as it is the first time that we have prepared an integrated strategy for a group of member states who have to face the same challenges and who may benefit from the same opportunities.
77,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_12,[{'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'nordic investment bank'}| {'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'european investment bank'}| {'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],in financial terms although there is no additional financing from the eu budget the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and a more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the european investment bank or the nordic investment bank.
78,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_2,[],of course it is not a complete surprise to me that parliament is taking such an interest in the strategy.

83,dev/20090916-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20090916-11:10:36_18,[],responsibility must rest with the relevant member states and other stakeholders directly involved on the ground.

356,dev/20180418-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20180418-15:43:34_3,[],but i would also agree it is very important to understand that there is a missing brick in this wall and that is the e privacy regulation.

371,dev/20180207-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20180207-19:52:58_7,[],too narrow a focus means that we will be missing some targets.

400,dev/20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-21:01:48_5,[],however it is a step that should not be taken lightly.

402,dev/20180702-0900-PLENARY-en_20180702-19:18:18_4,[],we need to understand and be aware of that.
403,dev/20121119-0900-PLENARY-20-en_20121119-21:10:43_2,[],budget consolidation needs to be complemented by a social investment strategy that will address the social employment and education targets of the eu two thousand and twenty strategy.

416,dev/20201007-0900-PLENARY-en_20201007-12:58:09_8,[],so my question is basically what is the commission doing to prevent the execution of these innocent people who only dream of democracy and freedom?

839,dev/20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_11,[],hence the need for support for these reforms in the context where many interests can play against especially in pre election years.

841,dev/20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:44:15_19,[],if we are serious about our goal we cannot slow down the procedures.

843,dev/20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_7,[],i am grateful to the commissioner that you although it is not included in the joint declaration explicitly referred to that because that is what it is also about.
844,dev/20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-20:54:28_8,[],we need to be very clear in this regard.
845,dev/20180612-0900-PLENARY-en_20180612-21:23:51_2,[],however the eternally crucial issue remains that of the implementation.

849,dev/20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_8,[],happily we have the perfect opportunity to play it and play it repeatedly.

852,dev/20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_11,[],you don't.
853,dev/20171002-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20171002-18:08:33_12,[],our hand is potentially a lot better than you understand.

857,dev/20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:03:25_0,[],that is quite difficult to explain briefly but it is about not shuffling money around from one country to another and not particularly that large scale recipient countries give money to the commission that the commission then gives them back and tells them what to do.
858,dev/20151027-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20151027-21:03:25_1,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],rather it is focusing on countries like yours in situations like yours so that cohesion achieves sustainable economic growth and lifts people out of that situation for the benefit of everybody within the eu on a limited basis not forever.
859,dev/20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_14,[],it will be an unnecessary collection of much information about travellers who are completely innocent.

861,dev/20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_7,[],we are not fixing the system which is not working because some of the member states' authorities are not thoroughly working with the system and feeding information into it.
862,dev/20171025-0900-PLENARY-4-en_20171025-09:28:48_2,[],we have to check their passports and that is exactly what we are doing.

866,dev/20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:27:02_2,[],but look for own resources.

868,dev/20170913-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20170913-11:45:22_1,[{'type': 'loc'| 'filler': 'europe'}],this means that life for people in europe is better and that is what people expect from

872,dev/20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_14,[],where the risk assessment has shown that the country of origin presents a higher risk of administrative corruption or in countries where enforcement of national laws is weak additional guarantees are necessary to underpin the certified legality.
873,dev/20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_12,[],the principle of due diligence reflects the legal obligation of a proactive behaviour to a certain legality and needs to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be reasonably assured.
874,dev/20090421-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20090421-21:47:39_3,[],we should keep in mind that patterns of tropical deforestation are the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which vary in importance in different locations.
