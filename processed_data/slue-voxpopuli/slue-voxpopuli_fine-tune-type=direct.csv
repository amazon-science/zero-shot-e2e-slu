4513,fine-tune/20170427-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170427-09:14:19_1,[],my concerns are based in a number of areas.

4515,fine-tune/20170427-0900-PLENARY-6-en_20170427-09:14:19_5,[{'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'world bank'}| {'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'eib'}],i wanted cast iron guarantees against conflicts of interest especially in the area of disbarment policy where the eib falls well short of the standards set by the world bank.

4525,fine-tune/20100519-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20100519-21:00:31_6,[],it is vitally important that these funds are properly and efficiently spent and accounted for.
4526,fine-tune/20100519-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20100519-21:00:31_8,[],it is also important to address the issue of compensating for and replacing lost energy capacity.

4530,fine-tune/20100519-0900-PLENARY-12-en_20100519-21:00:31_5,[],a lot of money of course is involved in this decommissioning process.
