6,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_5,[],the directive requires that farmers take all responsible steps to ensure that animals under their care are not caused unnecessary pain suffering or injury.

8,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_13,[],this priority is particularly relevant because we continue to see a widespread lack of compliance regarding animal welfare rules across many member states.
9,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_7,[],this opinion provides member states and farmers with data on aspects of farming systems which may put the welfare of the rabbits at risk.

12,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_8,[],the rules of the directive should be seen in conjunction with this opinion.

14,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_10,[],against this background and in line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality the commission takes the view that the member states involved are better placed to address the relevant issues concerning rabbit production.
15,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_4,[{'type': 'cardinal'| 'filler': 'fifty eight'}],fifty eight concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes.
16,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_14,[],in consideration of this analysis and given its limited resources the commission does not consider it appropriate to propose an initiative on the welfare of farm rabbits.
17,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_2,[],the report encourages the commission to take a number of non legislative actions such as drawing up a roadmap to include guidelines on good practices and a commission recommendation relating to rabbit health welfare and housing.
18,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_12,[{'type': 'cardinal'| 'filler': 'one'}| {'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],better enforcement of the eu animal welfare legislation is one of the key priorities for animal welfare and the commission has invested substantial resources in pursuit of this aim.

22,fine-tune/20130909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20130909-20:54:22_7,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}| {'type': 'ordinal'| 'filler': 'third'}| {'type': 'loc'| 'filler': 'europe'}| {'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'european parliament'}],today the european parliament is sending out a strong and unmistakable message to the governments in europe that they must live up to their commitments in the third energy package and we are also highlighting the importance of a more coordinated approach at eu level towards national capacity mechanisms. national capacity mechanisms can be necessary in some circumstances but much too often they are counterproductive as regards the aim of creating cross border markets. i therefore strongly support the call to the commission to ensure a stronger and more coordinated approach capable of guaranteeing that capacity mechanisms will be transparent
23,fine-tune/20130909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20130909-21:23:58_11,[{'type': 'date'| 'filler': 'next year'}| {'type': 'norp'| 'filler': 'european'}],before the european elections next year we can implement much of the legislation mentioned in my report.
24,fine-tune/20100907-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20100907-12:55:03_4,[{'type': 'ordinal'| 'filler': 'first'}],the commission will take its stand express itself and make commitments if necessary at the time of the first reading vote.

27,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:38:51_6,[],however as optimal bio waste policies may differ from country to country or even between regions further analysis on the grounds of subsidiarity is necessary.

29,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:38:51_11,[{'type': 'law'| 'filler': 'sewage sludge directive'}],analysing the viability of setting minimum standards for the use of bio waste in agriculture within the revision of the sewage sludge directive;

31,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:35:56_3,[{'type': 'loc'| 'filler': 'europe'}],the rapporteur lost my support on the point where he talks about a mandatory that means compulsory separate collection regime across europe.
32,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:35:56_4,[],i object to this in principle on the grounds of subsidiarity and i object most particularly on the grounds that it seeks to lock in a method that in many places is being superseded by high tech autoclave and other technology.
33,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:35:56_5,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],in other words it is becoming outmoded before we have even set it up and this really puts eu regulation in its worst possible light.
34,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:35:56_6,[],i object to the knee jerk reaction to call for more regulation rather than create incentives and i urge the commission to maintain its position and oppose the call for compulsion.

38,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_13,[],these are determined by member states individually.

40,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_12,[],the commission has however no competence to regulate the level of prices of medicinal treatments.
41,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_7,[],of course the discussion on the impact of prices on the affordability of medicines for public payers and patients goes far beyond the specific case of hepatitis c treatments.
42,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_14,[],thus there can be no price caps imposed by the commission.
43,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_9,[],as regards support to research and development the commission is hopeful that the ongoing innovative medicines initiative will help speed up the development of better and safer medicines.

46,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_16,[],another way in which the commission could assist would be by further exploring the use of the joint procurement mechanism to obtain more advantageous price offers from the pharmaceutical industry.

55,fine-tune/20160913-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20160913-18:18:25_1,[],sometimes we forget it.

61,fine-tune/20140416-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140416-20:56:31_7,[],but that was difficult to achieve in practice.
62,fine-tune/20140416-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140416-20:56:31_16,[],defending the effectiveness of competition authorities is good news for the victims of anti trust infringements.
63,fine-tune/20140416-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140416-20:56:31_9,[],consumers and small companies especially have found it difficult to obtain compensation for the harm they suffered.

65,fine-tune/20140416-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140416-20:56:31_12,[],the directive includes rules that remove the current obstacles.

1049,fine-tune/20170216-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20170216-08:47:27_5,[],so the aviation air agreements we have seen are urgent are important.

1366,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:10:56_3,[],as a result we agreed to empower individuals with strong and enforceable data protection rights.
1367,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:10:56_5,[],this resulted in a general data protection regulation laying down harmonised rules for processing of personal data.
1368,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:10:56_6,[],these new rules will end the fragmentation stemming from differences in implementation of the current directive.

1376,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:33:39_3,[],the protection of that information throws up some obvious issues the security of the information held who has legitimate access to it and how to protect it from highly sophisticated criminals.
1377,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:33:39_4,[],these are not easy issues to resolve.

1382,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:33:39_9,[],therefore the protection of individual citizens' most private information must remain the responsibility of democratic nation states answerable to their people.

1390,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:24:09_10,[],this has meant that we have created a package which has been comprehensive.

1777,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:36:03_5,[],i am convinced that a proper implementation of the strategy should start with an inventory of all current trade negotiations. for this to occur you would need to reallocate sufficient human resources within the commission services.
1778,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:36:03_3,[],however on the other hand there are increasing numbers of those concerned and fearful of the potential impact of the trade issues. we have to be able to come up with new ways to communicate these issues more effectively and to address citizens' concerns.

1786,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:19:29_5,[],furthermore we are supporting responsible business practices including enhanced transparency for large companies on non financial information as well as the uptake in implementation of internationally recognised guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility.
1787,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:19:29_7,[],but being a frontrunner is of course not enough.

1790,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:19:29_24,[],so i want to thank you very much for these reports.

1798,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:41:14_4,[],this is why open trade has to be accompanied by adequate flanking policies including access to a reformed globalisation adjustment fund. the losers from trade liberalisation cannot and should not be left alone.

1801,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:41:14_3,[],however as a previous speaker has just said we cannot ignore that trade does not benefit all. it is therefore essential we make sure the benefits of trade reach the widest range of people.
1802,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:41:14_7,[],and we agree with the commissioner that the proliferation of ftas should not lead to the death of the multilateral trading system.

1804,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:59:22_5,[],we can draw conclusions in our trade agreements on how to fight against corruption how to make governments more accountable and how to help the freedom of civil society.

1810,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_3,[],quite the opposite actually because trade currently and at the moment often increases inequality and leads to poverty and that urgently needs to change.
1811,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_4,[],i think actually your trade strategy commissioner is a step in the right direction.
1812,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_5,[],but now we need to move onwards from the nice words about human rights and values towards the implementation and that needs to include also binding rules.
1813,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_6,[],but instead what we see the commission doing is proposing trade sanctions against partner countries that are not readmitting migrants.
1814,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_7,[],so instead of having trade sanctions on human rights violations we are actually sanctioning countries who are not closing their border enough and i really hope that colleagues will join me in saying that this is just outright wrong.

1819,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:43:34_3,[],areas of concern still remain within this trade strategy protectionist measures in the form of a retaliatory public procurement instrument and continual insistence on gi protection for non agricultural products.

2406,fine-tune/20141215-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141215-18:14:07_1,[],we give the highest financial value to those commodities that are scarcest on earth but sadly that logic applies to animals as well even to the point that the rarer a species becomes the more sought after and the more valuable it or its body parts become.
2407,fine-tune/20141215-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141215-18:14:07_2,[],it is now the stroke of midnight for a number of the world's most endangered species.

2413,fine-tune/20141215-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141215-18:16:45_1,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}| {'type': 'law'| 'filler': 'cites'}],issues relating to cites have a crucial impact on eu policy in a great number of areas. wildlife trafficking for example is not only unethical because of the harm it causes to animals but is also depriving local communities of sustainable development opportunities robbing countries of potential tax revenues deterring investment providing financing to terrorist groups and enabling the spread of diseases like ebola.
2414,fine-tune/20141215-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141215-18:16:45_2,[{'type': 'law'| 'filler': 'cites'}| {'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],so i strongly believe that the eu should take a leadership role in cites in putting a stop to the trafficking of tigers and all other endangered species;

2416,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:13:57_5,[],therefore packaging techniques such as modified atmosphere packaging and innovations such as active and intelligent packaging can ameliorate this. my party and i therefore believe that plastic packaging which cannot be reused should be made of a substance that can be recycled.
2417,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:13:57_0,[],madam president my party and i strongly value products materials and resources in our economy and we believe that these should be kept in use for as long as possible in order to minimise the generation of waste in our environment.
2418,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:13:57_2,[],however food packaging has led to a reduction in food wastage.
2419,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:49:52_6,[],and as far as packaging is concerned we will be extremely ambitious and we will come up with legislation and we want this to happen very quickly.

2423,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:49:52_15,[],this is what we will do and this is a promise i make on behalf of all of us we will make proposals for legislation where we can.
2424,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:49:52_18,[],but i have the feeling that given the sense of urgency that is shared by industry we will be able to do a lot of things together as well.
2425,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:49:52_16,[],but we will not rush into things especially if we haven't got the science right yet or if we can still wait for industry to do its part.

2549,fine-tune/20171023-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171023-17:20:30_1,[],of course we know that this debate is crucial for us but we do not agree to change the order.

2557,fine-tune/20110217-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20110217-10:02:10_11,[],the monitoring and reporting systems guarantee more transparency better access to information and increased possibilities for the stakeholders to give their opinion at an early stage of the consideration of the projects.

2568,fine-tune/20110217-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20110217-10:15:59_3,[],the commissioner made this very clear.
2569,fine-tune/20110217-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20110217-10:15:59_4,[],a relaxation of the commercial criteria on which the bank has operated up to now will inevitably result in the guarantee being called on.

2574,fine-tune/20110217-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20110217-10:30:26_3,[],oversight systems and transparency will be crucial when using the balance sheet for leverage as has been shown by the financial crisis where banks were not always fully aware of the extent of their liabilities.

4290,fine-tune/20140311-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20140311-10:33:49_9,[],the rapporteur is also very satisfied with the open and constructive work he has had with civil society during the work on of this report. ngos were particularly helpful regarding transparency and on social and environmental aspects etc.
4291,fine-tune/20140311-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20140311-10:33:49_8,[],from the agreement reached it is however clear that the decision to use reflows in this way is a one off deal and cannot be used as a precedent in other contexts.

4308,fine-tune/20140311-0900-PLENARY-7-en_20140311-11:02:08_4,[],the answer might be that investment will be less effective in those countries when expansion is constrained by a currency that is overvalued for their economies.

4319,fine-tune/20180116-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180116-19:51:12_22,[],last but not least it is our joint responsibility to wield trade tools to effectively protect security and human rights and the starting point for this is to make the correct analysis of the threat landscape.

4321,fine-tune/20180116-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180116-19:51:12_20,[],this illustrates the convergence of security threats from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to cyberproliferation and terrorism.
4322,fine-tune/20180116-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180116-19:51:12_11,[],the proposed general export authorisation is an important step in that direction but i agree that we should identify efforts to find the right balance between security and trade in encryption products.

4327,fine-tune/20180116-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180116-19:51:12_27,[],so that is why we need to have a proposal that is capable of continuously adjusting to a constantly changing security technological and economic environment and we need as you so rightly say in your report to make the system future proof.
4328,fine-tune/20180116-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180116-19:51:12_18,[],i would also like to point out that there are obvious links between different facets of the threat environment.
4329,fine-tune/20180116-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20180116-19:51:12_21,[],so we must respond to the risk of sensitive items falling into the hands of non state actors and in particular terrorists and ensure that controls contribute to preventing terrorism.
