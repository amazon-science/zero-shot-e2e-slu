6,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_5,[],the directive requires that farmers take all responsible steps to ensure that animals under their care are not caused unnecessary pain suffering or injury.

8,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_13,[],this priority is particularly relevant because we continue to see a widespread lack of compliance regarding animal welfare rules across many member states.
9,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_7,[],this opinion provides member states and farmers with data on aspects of farming systems which may put the welfare of the rabbits at risk.

12,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_8,[],the rules of the directive should be seen in conjunction with this opinion.

14,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_10,[],against this background and in line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality the commission takes the view that the member states involved are better placed to address the relevant issues concerning rabbit production.
15,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_4,[{'type': 'cardinal'| 'filler': 'fifty eight'}],fifty eight concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes.
16,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_14,[],in consideration of this analysis and given its limited resources the commission does not consider it appropriate to propose an initiative on the welfare of farm rabbits.
17,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_2,[],the report encourages the commission to take a number of non legislative actions such as drawing up a roadmap to include guidelines on good practices and a commission recommendation relating to rabbit health welfare and housing.
18,fine-tune/20170313-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20170313-21:48:27_12,[{'type': 'cardinal'| 'filler': 'one'}| {'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],better enforcement of the eu animal welfare legislation is one of the key priorities for animal welfare and the commission has invested substantial resources in pursuit of this aim.

22,fine-tune/20130909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20130909-20:54:22_7,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}| {'type': 'ordinal'| 'filler': 'third'}| {'type': 'loc'| 'filler': 'europe'}| {'type': 'org'| 'filler': 'european parliament'}],today the european parliament is sending out a strong and unmistakable message to the governments in europe that they must live up to their commitments in the third energy package and we are also highlighting the importance of a more coordinated approach at eu level towards national capacity mechanisms. national capacity mechanisms can be necessary in some circumstances but much too often they are counterproductive as regards the aim of creating cross border markets. i therefore strongly support the call to the commission to ensure a stronger and more coordinated approach capable of guaranteeing that capacity mechanisms will be transparent
23,fine-tune/20130909-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20130909-21:23:58_11,[{'type': 'date'| 'filler': 'next year'}| {'type': 'norp'| 'filler': 'european'}],before the european elections next year we can implement much of the legislation mentioned in my report.
24,fine-tune/20100907-0900-PLENARY-5-en_20100907-12:55:03_4,[{'type': 'ordinal'| 'filler': 'first'}],the commission will take its stand express itself and make commitments if necessary at the time of the first reading vote.

27,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:38:51_6,[],however as optimal bio waste policies may differ from country to country or even between regions further analysis on the grounds of subsidiarity is necessary.

29,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:38:51_11,[{'type': 'law'| 'filler': 'sewage sludge directive'}],analysing the viability of setting minimum standards for the use of bio waste in agriculture within the revision of the sewage sludge directive;

31,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:35:56_3,[{'type': 'loc'| 'filler': 'europe'}],the rapporteur lost my support on the point where he talks about a mandatory that means compulsory separate collection regime across europe.
32,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:35:56_4,[],i object to this in principle on the grounds of subsidiarity and i object most particularly on the grounds that it seeks to lock in a method that in many places is being superseded by high tech autoclave and other technology.
33,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:35:56_5,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],in other words it is becoming outmoded before we have even set it up and this really puts eu regulation in its worst possible light.
34,fine-tune/20100705-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20100705-22:35:56_6,[],i object to the knee jerk reaction to call for more regulation rather than create incentives and i urge the commission to maintain its position and oppose the call for compulsion.

38,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_13,[],these are determined by member states individually.

40,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_12,[],the commission has however no competence to regulate the level of prices of medicinal treatments.
41,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_7,[],of course the discussion on the impact of prices on the affordability of medicines for public payers and patients goes far beyond the specific case of hepatitis c treatments.
42,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_14,[],thus there can be no price caps imposed by the commission.
43,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_9,[],as regards support to research and development the commission is hopeful that the ongoing innovative medicines initiative will help speed up the development of better and safer medicines.

46,fine-tune/20140916-0900-PLENARY-19-en_20140916-22:04:17_16,[],another way in which the commission could assist would be by further exploring the use of the joint procurement mechanism to obtain more advantageous price offers from the pharmaceutical industry.

55,fine-tune/20160913-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20160913-18:18:25_1,[],sometimes we forget it.

61,fine-tune/20140416-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140416-20:56:31_7,[],but that was difficult to achieve in practice.
62,fine-tune/20140416-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140416-20:56:31_16,[],defending the effectiveness of competition authorities is good news for the victims of anti trust infringements.
63,fine-tune/20140416-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140416-20:56:31_9,[],consumers and small companies especially have found it difficult to obtain compensation for the harm they suffered.

65,fine-tune/20140416-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20140416-20:56:31_12,[],the directive includes rules that remove the current obstacles.

1049,fine-tune/20170216-0900-PLENARY-2-en_20170216-08:47:27_5,[],so the aviation air agreements we have seen are urgent are important.

1366,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:10:56_3,[],as a result we agreed to empower individuals with strong and enforceable data protection rights.
1367,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:10:56_5,[],this resulted in a general data protection regulation laying down harmonised rules for processing of personal data.
1368,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:10:56_6,[],these new rules will end the fragmentation stemming from differences in implementation of the current directive.

1376,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:33:39_3,[],the protection of that information throws up some obvious issues the security of the information held who has legitimate access to it and how to protect it from highly sophisticated criminals.
1377,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:33:39_4,[],these are not easy issues to resolve.

1382,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:33:39_9,[],therefore the protection of individual citizens' most private information must remain the responsibility of democratic nation states answerable to their people.

1390,fine-tune/20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:24:09_10,[],this has meant that we have created a package which has been comprehensive.

1777,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:36:03_5,[],i am convinced that a proper implementation of the strategy should start with an inventory of all current trade negotiations. for this to occur you would need to reallocate sufficient human resources within the commission services.
1778,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:36:03_3,[],however on the other hand there are increasing numbers of those concerned and fearful of the potential impact of the trade issues. we have to be able to come up with new ways to communicate these issues more effectively and to address citizens' concerns.

1786,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:19:29_5,[],furthermore we are supporting responsible business practices including enhanced transparency for large companies on non financial information as well as the uptake in implementation of internationally recognised guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility.
1787,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:19:29_7,[],but being a frontrunner is of course not enough.

1790,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:19:29_24,[],so i want to thank you very much for these reports.

1798,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:41:14_4,[],this is why open trade has to be accompanied by adequate flanking policies including access to a reformed globalisation adjustment fund. the losers from trade liberalisation cannot and should not be left alone.

1801,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:41:14_3,[],however as a previous speaker has just said we cannot ignore that trade does not benefit all. it is therefore essential we make sure the benefits of trade reach the widest range of people.
1802,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:41:14_7,[],and we agree with the commissioner that the proliferation of ftas should not lead to the death of the multilateral trading system.

1804,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:59:22_5,[],we can draw conclusions in our trade agreements on how to fight against corruption how to make governments more accountable and how to help the freedom of civil society.

1810,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_3,[],quite the opposite actually because trade currently and at the moment often increases inequality and leads to poverty and that urgently needs to change.
1811,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_4,[],i think actually your trade strategy commissioner is a step in the right direction.
1812,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_5,[],but now we need to move onwards from the nice words about human rights and values towards the implementation and that needs to include also binding rules.
1813,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_6,[],but instead what we see the commission doing is proposing trade sanctions against partner countries that are not readmitting migrants.
1814,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:51:43_7,[],so instead of having trade sanctions on human rights violations we are actually sanctioning countries who are not closing their border enough and i really hope that colleagues will join me in saying that this is just outright wrong.

1819,fine-tune/20160704-0900-PLENARY-15-en_20160704-21:43:34_3,[],areas of concern still remain within this trade strategy protectionist measures in the form of a retaliatory public procurement instrument and continual insistence on gi protection for non agricultural products.
