2254,fine-tune/20140225-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140225-11:34:48_20,[],therefore we cannot be complacent.
2255,fine-tune/20140225-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140225-11:34:48_4,[{'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'greece'}],i very much appreciate and commend the efforts of greece to restore economic growth and job creation under very difficult circumstances and following decades of economic and policy mismanagement. i have to say that i find

2260,fine-tune/20140225-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140225-10:25:00_5,[],i would really like to ask their representatives here whether they are going to take action on the issue and start negotiating such an agreement or not?
2261,fine-tune/20140225-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140225-10:25:00_6,[],it is also clear that if we want the eu two thousand and twenty process the semester to have democratic legitimacy we need to involve civil society and social partners much more strongly.

2264,fine-tune/20140225-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140225-09:29:27_22,[],but we have to solve the problems of over indebtedness and lack of competitiveness.

2268,fine-tune/20140225-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140225-09:29:27_26,[],therefore we have to unleash the investment potential but we also have to step up our efforts for structural reforms with great ambitions.
2269,fine-tune/20140225-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140225-09:29:27_1,[],we have not yet left the crisis fully behind us;

2406,fine-tune/20141215-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141215-18:14:07_1,[],we give the highest financial value to those commodities that are scarcest on earth but sadly that logic applies to animals as well even to the point that the rarer a species becomes the more sought after and the more valuable it or its body parts become.

2414,fine-tune/20141215-0900-PLENARY-14-en_20141215-18:16:45_2,[{'type': 'law'| 'filler': 'cites'}| {'type': 'gpe'| 'filler': 'eu'}],so i strongly believe that the eu should take a leadership role in cites in putting a stop to the trafficking of tigers and all other endangered species;

2416,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:13:57_5,[],therefore packaging techniques such as modified atmosphere packaging and innovations such as active and intelligent packaging can ameliorate this. my party and i therefore believe that plastic packaging which cannot be reused should be made of a substance that can be recycled.
2417,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:13:57_0,[],madam president my party and i strongly value products materials and resources in our economy and we believe that these should be kept in use for as long as possible in order to minimise the generation of waste in our environment.

2419,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:49:52_6,[],and as far as packaging is concerned we will be extremely ambitious and we will come up with legislation and we want this to happen very quickly.

2433,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:16:42_3,[],that is why i welcomed the proposal for quality standards for recycled plastics and the intention to incentivise packaging for the construction and car industries to use more of them.

2489,fine-tune/20180117-0900-PLENARY-18-en_20180117-19:18:39_4,[],we need to make sure that we remain competitive and we do not let other continents run in front of us in the competitiveness stakes.

2542,fine-tune/20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_8,[],without essential balancing mechanisms this directive will become an instrument which in fact creates discrimination.
2543,fine-tune/20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:59:10_3,[],i strongly believe that no person should ever be discriminated against on the basis of his or her religion or belief disability or age.

2549,fine-tune/20171023-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20171023-17:20:30_1,[],of course we know that this debate is crucial for us but we do not agree to change the order.

3810,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:34:08_8,[],these if successful will have significant implications on the living conditions in that region in those countries concerned.

3812,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:34:08_5,[],i am a little bit concerned that it was quite difficult to negotiate the budget for this programme it is as if we always have a difference between the ambition and the understanding that we need the means to tackle the issues at the roots but then when we have a programme which has a solid basis we have the difficulties to allocate the necessary financial means. but i think that the outcome is a positive one it is something that we can build on.
3813,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:22:47_16,[],how do we solve these issues?
3814,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:22:47_10,[],without food and water we cannot make it.

3830,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:22:47_15,[],we have to acknowledge that these issues are the root causes of migration both within and beyond borders.
3831,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:22:47_13,[],it means the livelihoods of rural and urban populations and it means territorial development.

3834,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:22:47_20,[],but we have to put in the means we have to put in the resources.

3836,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:22:47_26,[{'type': 'norp'| 'filler': 'mediterranean'}| {'type': 'person'| 'filler': 'predrag matvejevi'}| {'type': 'norp'| 'filler': 'croatian'}],as the great croatian writer predrag matvejevi once said and i quote being mediterranean entails more than history or geography tradition or memory birth right or belief.
3837,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:22:47_17,[],i think that part of that answer is exactly prima.

3842,fine-tune/20170612-0900-PLENARY-11-en_20170612-17:48:06_6,[],we have to solve this we have to create a technology we have to have the innovation that will change for the better and that is something that we will do together.

4390,fine-tune/20130520-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20130520-20:21:39_12,[],but again there will always be some sort of mechanism.

4392,fine-tune/20130520-0900-PLENARY-16-en_20130520-20:21:39_2,[],it will take some time before it works in all member states but it will mean that all member states will have the possibility of receiving asylum seekers in a fair transparent and humane way.
